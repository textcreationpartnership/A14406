            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Admirall and <hi>Spina,</hi> he iudged them of ſuche reaſon as not to be denied, warning <hi>Spina</hi> to prepare him ſelfe agaynſt the firſte of Iuly, when the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould begin in the after noone. <hi>Spina</hi> intreated <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Barbaſta,</hi> miniſter to the quéene of <hi>Nauar</hi> to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him in this diſputation, who at the day and houre afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde, conducted by thrée Gentlemen appoynted by the duke of <hi>Buyllon,</hi> went to the L. of <hi>Montpenſiers</hi> houſe, where the duke of <hi>Buyllon</hi> (aduertiſed belike of their comming) mette the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the hal: and there (induced as it ſéemed by the doctors who were in the chamber fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he came) aſked <hi>Spina</hi> if (afore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of the conference) he were determined to make his prayers, according to the cuſtom of the reformed churches: He anſwered yea, and that neither he nor his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, either might, or ought to ſet vpon a matter of ſuche importance, as to treate vpon the myſteries of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="tcp:12892:5"/>
afore they prepared them ſelues thervnto by inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the name of God. With which anſwere he returned eftſones into the Chamber of the Doctors, who after ſome priuate counſell amongeſt them ſelues, appoynted Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> to tell them, that for their parts they would not aſſiſte their prayers, and that there was no more reaſon for them to be preſent when they prayed, than for the miniſters to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare their Maſſe. The miniſters anſwered, that in good conſcience they could not beginne to diſpute, afore they had prayed to God, and for the Doctors they had libertie, either to aſſiſte or be abſent from their prayers at their pleaſure: but touching them ſelues, they were content to make their prayers in the place where the aſſembly and conference ſhoulde bee, onely they ſayde there was greate difference betweene their prayers (which haue conformitie with the pure worde of God, as they them ſelues confeſſe,) and the matter of their Maſſe, which conteynes many things quite contrary, as is eaſely ſeene and iudged by ſuche as will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it by the rule of the Scripture, and therfore (by reaſon of the impietie and idolatrie in their Maſſe) as they can not any way communicate therewith without offence to God, and bring them ſelues guyltie afore him: ſo yet, neither he nor the other Doctors his companions, ſtoode barde from the ſocietie of their prayers by that difficultie, bicauſe there was neither poynt nor article, which (by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) was not holly and conſonant to God. Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> replied, that they reſted vpon a ſmall matter: but they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that as the principall exerciſe of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſtoode vppon prayer, ſo it was alſo the moſte neceſſarie meane to obtayne Gods grace, without the which mortall men coulde not attayne to any ſucceſſe in their doings, and therefore very dangerous to omitte it: they tolde him alſo, that they marueled on his behalfe, that profeſſing the name of a Doctor and a Deuine, he made ſuch a negligent eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prayer, which is the true practiſe, fruite, and vſe of all the knowledge touching God and his worde, like as by this the worlde might diſcerne, what was the nature of their
<pb facs="tcp:12892:5"/>
iudgementes, who meaſured diuinitie by idle and vayne ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. He anſwered that the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> would neuer ſuffer ſuch a brauerie in his houſe, and muche leſſe that it ſhould be ſayde, that it was a place for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to make their prayers in. The miniſters proteſted to be farre from their profeſſion to braue it, and that muche leſſe they would vſe any brauerie towards Princes (whom they honored with all feare and obedience) but that they would condemne themſelues if they vſed it to any man, of what meane condition ſoeuer he were: wherwith they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that aſwell he as others, which layde ſuch ſlaunders vpon them afore Princes, to kindle &amp; enflame them againſt them, ſhoulde one day giue reaſon of their doings afore the maieſtie of God. Here Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> aſked them why they ſtoode ſo reſolutely vpon this poynt of prayer: they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the purpoſe of the Conference, was to reueale the true ſenſe of the Scripture, and deliuer it to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Bearers, which coulde not be done without the ſpirite of God, who cleareth the vnderſtanding of men to comprehende it, and openeth their mouthes to pronounce it, in which reſpecte they are to implore and obteyne Gods grace by prayers: beſides, God hath commaunded all ſuche as haue neede of wiſedome, to demaunde it of him, to ſearche what they would finde, &amp; to knocke at the gate if they would haue it opened to them: all which beeing not otherwiſe to be obteyned than by prayers, they concluded, that for that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion their inuocation was neceſſarie. They alleaged more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that all things ought to be referred to the glory of god, and therefore prayer to be requiſite in the beginning, and thankeſgiuing in the ende, and conſummation of all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors, euen as when wee begin and ende the ordinary refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our bodies, wee bleſſe and glorifie the name of God.</p>
            <p>Here Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> tolde them that they ſhould not haue any let to pray, ſo that they prayed in their hartes: but they anſwered, that that ſuffiſed not, but that they muſte aſwell exerciſe their mouth, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> commaundes. Then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw you apart (ſayth he) and make your prayers al alone:
<pb facs="tcp:12892:6"/>
they tolde him that was alſo inconuenient in ſuche a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as béeing commaunded by God to make their lighte ſhine afore men, to the ende, that ſeeing their good works, they might haue meane to glorifie God, and be edified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: beſides, by this they might procure cauſe of ſlaunder to their neighbours, as to confirme the lewde opinion rayſed by their aduerſaries touching their doctrine and exerciſes, which is, that in reſpecte of the errours and blaſphemies, they durſie not publiſh it: and therefore the better to purge this reproche, they thought it moſte conuenient, that as they were to ſpeake publikely, ſo alſo their prayers might not be kepte from the hearers. Laſtly they ſayde, in reaſon and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they ought not to be denied there the authoritie which the king had agreed vnto them in the conference at <hi>Poyſſy,</hi> where in all the ſeuerall aſſemblies it was lawefull for them to make publike prayer to God, afore they entered any ſpéeche of diſputation. They added for their laſte reaſon, that it was néedefull to comprehende within their prayers, bothe they &amp; al ſuch as ſhould aſſiſte the conference, to the ende that by the helpe of Gods grace, aſwel they as others might be made cleane from all paſſions, as béeing hindered with nothing to iudge rightly of ſuche matters as ſhall fall in queſtion of the one and other ſide, leauing by that meanes a facilitie to the hearers the better to make their profite. I am aſhamed to recite in this place a worde which eſcaped from doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> in this talke, who in a diſdayne to God and his ſeruice, ſayde, that if the miniſters wold go pray, he wold go piſſe the while: the ſame ſeeming ſo impudente to the miniſters, that they cried, what reſolution, what counſell, yea what one good worde to bee hoped for in a heart filled with ſuche apparant, diſdayne of God?</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Buyllon,</hi> and the ſayde Doctor <hi>Ruze,</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtancie of the Miniſters not to enter Conference, onleſſe they prayed publikely in the preſence of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, after they had imparted the ſame with the lord of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſier,</hi> and the other doctors that were with him, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſende them away, as not meaning to diſpute with-them
<pb facs="tcp:12892:6"/>
vnder ſuche condition.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Miniſters departed, &amp; being called backe againe before they were at our Ladies bridge, they returned with expectation of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to their requeſt, wherin notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they were deceiued. For Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> meeting them at the gate, tolde them for a finall Reſolution, that if they wold pray, they ſhoulde haue a houſe appoynted for that purpoſe: only the Lord of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> wold not ſuffer them to make his houſe their place of Prayer, nor that any of his houſhold partake with their Prayers: whereunto the Miniſters An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that in this, their requeſt was rather reſtrained than ſatiſfied, and therefore they coulde Anſwere them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes than afore.</p>
            <p>Héere Doctor <hi>Ruze</hi> miniſtred particular ſpéeche to <hi>Spyna,</hi> to whom in ſcoffing manner, he told, that he ſaw two cauſes why he was of ſo hard a deſire to be drawn into diſputation, and that héeretofore he had bene of their ſecte and companie, but now he was cut of. <hi>Spyna</hi> Anſwered, that if he had ment to eſchue the conference, he wold not haue taken the trauaile of .viij. leagues in ſo great diſtemper of heat, and muche leſſe left his Churche, more deare to him than any other thing, to come to them in their owne houſes. Touching his departing from their ſocietie, he eſtéemed it one of the greateſt benefits that euer happened to him, for the which he had cauſe to yeld continual thankes to God. And bicauſe neither he nor his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip ſhould dout indirectly of his readineſſe to diſpute, he laide afore him a meane by which bothe parties might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied, as to trauerſe the diſputation by writing, the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſte conuenient, to intercepte all contentions: that the Arguments and Anſwers may be the better handled and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: that the people ſhuld be the better edified: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in this manner there was no daunger of alterations, either by additions or detractions: <hi>Ruze</hi> Anſwered that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be wrytten, which hath not earſt bene wrytten: euen ſo ſayth <hi>Spyna</hi> we can pronounce nothing, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath not bene ſpoken.</p>
            <p>This was the Reſolute end of all their ſpéeches, by which
<pb facs="tcp:12892:7"/>
may be gathered the will and diſpoſition of the doctors to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conference with the Miniſters: to whome euen in the beginning, to preuent their further procéeding, they offered a condition which they knewe would not be accepted, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a publike conference of the ſcripture, and yet barde to pray publikely in the place and aſſiſtance where they ſhuld diſpute. Beſides, their intente is eaſily iudged by the order they eſtabliſhed touching the conference: For in place to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide conueniently for the eaſe and quiette of the Miniſters, come with no ſmal paines to them, they had procured at leaſt a hundred perſons of all qualities to enuiron the ſaide Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſo to amaze them, either with inreuerente ſcoffes, violent iniuries, or inciuile threates, that had not the three Gentlemen of the Duke of <hi>Buyllon,</hi> kept a preciſe care ouer them, they had bene in daunger of violent hurt. By their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings alſo may be diſcerned their regarde of duetie to God and holy Prayer, ſeeing they could not admit Prayer in their preſence. And laſtly, what vnderſtanding can they haue of the ſcripture, with what Faith can they handle Gods Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yea with what integritie and facultie can they preach and pronounce, ſeeing they diſdaine in their preſence Prayer to God to obtaine all things, as though theyr ſufficiencie were in aide of them ſelues, and not to proceede from God the Author of all lighte?</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T did not ſuffice the Doctors, by their inciuill meanes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the Preface, to offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe the conference appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them &amp; the twoo Miniſters: but alſo, (the rather to intercept the iuſt perſwaſion of the world) in the matter of their intowardneſſe, to enter ſo holy an exerciſe, they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned a brute againſt the Miniſters: that being no leſſe priuie to the weakneſſe of their cauſe, than their doctrine euill aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they refuſe to diſpute. The ſame ſpreading to the eares of the king and Quéene, &amp; alſo the Lord Admiral, who foreſeing the daungerous ſlaunder that might diſcende to the reformed Churches, if the cauſe were not wiſely and ſpéedily gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and conſtruing withall, this corrupt imputation to be layde vpon the Miniſters, the rather to deface their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: ſtoode in their excuſe afore their Maieſties, whom he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of a prompt readyneſſe in the Miniſters, to common with the Doctors in the defence of their Church and confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that by infallible Scripture, where and afore what reuerend teſtimonie they ſhould be brought, ſo that their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to pray to God in their beginning (as they had deſired) were not taken awaye, &amp; meanes for good order eſtabliſhed, the better to brydle the confuſion of popular ſhowtes and voyces, as happen ordinarily in the Schooles of Sophiſters, and people inclyned to cauell.</p>
               <p>Thys ſpéeche of the Lord Admirall kindled ſuch a ſenſe of reaſon in the Lorde of <hi>Neuers,</hi> that, induced chiefly by the ſpirite of God, and partly by an heroycall inſtinct of heart, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring in deſire to aſpire to the direct truth of things: hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſutor to their Maieſties, that by their authoritie and
<pb facs="tcp:12892:8"/>
ſuffraunce, the ſayde diſputation might procéede, and be eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones reſtored: wherein as he preuayled to the full effect of his requeſt and purpoſe: ſo, after he had ymparted wyth the Lorde Admirall the diſpoſition of the King and Quéene, they ioyned in deuiſe touching the order to be obſerued in the ſayd conference, naming the ſayde Lorde of <hi>Neuers,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Buyllon,</hi> as Preſidents of the place, wyth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine numbers of Gentlemen mutuall aſſiſtauntes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and witneſſe the manner of their procéedings, prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding laſtly two Notaries of Parys, for eyther ſide to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and ſet downe in wryting the true diſcourſe of eyther ſeuerall parties.</p>
               <p>Theſe condicions thus determined by the Lordes, were alſo receyued of the Doctors <hi>Vigor</hi> and <hi>De ſainctes</hi> for the Papiſtes, and <hi>De ſpina</hi> and <hi>Sureau</hi> Miniſters: Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, according to the appointment the ninth of Iuly, at the Lorde of <hi>Neuers</hi> houſe, where, in hys preſence and hearing of the reaſt of the aſſiſtants, after the Miniſters had prayed, which the Doctors did ſhonne, (as retyring elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where till they had done) Doctor <hi>Vigor</hi> vndertooke the firſt ſpéeche, with proteſtation that neyther he nor his companion came thyther to enter argument with the Miniſters in any néede or meaning to be inſtructed in pointes of religion, and much leſſe to impugne in any ſort the counſels, and ſpecially that of <hi>Trent,</hi> by which they were forbidden to diſpute with Heretikes: Aſſuring reſolutely for themſelues, to abyde conſtantly in the fayth of the Church of Rome: onely ſuch was the requeſt of the Lorde of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> (who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime his daughter the Lady of <hi>Buyllon,</hi> had procured that conference) as they were the rather drawne thyther, aſwell to ſatiſfie hym, as alſo to declare their holy zeale to ſéeke and bring agayne to their flock, ſuch as were gone aſtray.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters for their partes proteſted lykewiſe, not to be enforced to conference by any doubt they made in anye article of their confeſſion, as knowing the ſame to conſent ſimplie and fully with the perfite worde of God, but rather

               <p>Theſe proteſtations thus mutually alledged, the Miniſters looked that the Doctors (according to the meaning of the Lorde of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> and deſire of his daughter) woulde beginne their diſputation, with the matter of the ſupper, and the Maſſe: albeit, vſing the example and pollicy of ſuch, as pretending the ſiege and batterie of a towne, beginne to raiſe their Trenches a farre off: ſo they, the better to prepare themſelues to decyde and conſult in the ſayde two poyntes, began to lay their foundation by the authoritie of the church, vpon the which they ſought to eſtabliſhe the certaintie of the articles of fayth, and generally of all the holye ſcripture: And ſo the demaundes and obiections paſſing from the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and aunſwers returned by the Miniſters: <hi>De ſainctes</hi> began, and <hi>Deſpina,</hi> aunſwered as followeth.</p>

               <p>No, but according to the inſtruction of antiquitie, we vſe diſtinction betwéene the Canonical and Apocryphall bookes, calling ſuch canonicall, vpon whoſe doctrine, both faith and all chriſtian religion is founded, and the other we name apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall,

               <p>All men ſay, and may ſaye as much, but for this reaſon it is an argument inſufficient, tyll I be warranted by effect and other proofes, how I may reſt and ſtay my ſelfe vppon it: Beſides, this aunſwere excéedes the lymites of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as preſuppoſing the ſcripture to be knowne to be the grounde of religion: and the propoſition was layde to giue the reaſon to aſſure me that the ſcripture was of God: and that we muſt put a diſtinction betwéene the bookes of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to iudge, whether the ende of the doctrine which is propownded, ſtretch to eſtabliſhe and exalt the honor and glorie of God, as if the ſame mooue exhortations to men, to withdrawe whollie their truſt from creatures, and reappoſe and lay it altogyther vpon God, to haue recourſe to hym in their neceſſities, to depende vpon his prouidence in all their tranſitorie affayres, and laſtly to prayſe hym with thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuing for all the benefits they haue: which being preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is no doubt that the doctrine including this purpoſe and ende, is not good and to be receyued: touching the obiection, that our former aunſwere fell from the boundes of the firſt propoſition, it ſéemes not ſo, bicauſe the firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propownded, tended to knowe what was the grounde of our religion, to the which it was aunſwered, that it was the wrytings of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>

               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deiſtes,</hi> or other heretikes, can not ſerue their turne with the ſayde aunſwere, for the confirmation of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, bicauſe the <hi>Deiſtes,</hi> denying Ieſus Chriſt, can not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, ſeing that to glorifie the father, it is néedefull firſt to knowe and glorifie the ſonne: and euen ſo the other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, who notknowing the truth, nor by conſequent, Ieſus Chriſt (whichis the waye, the lyfe, and the truth) muſte néedes be ignoraunt of God, and howe to glorifie hym. And where our aunſwere is noted ſuperfluous, or to wander in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently, we lay our ſelues to be meaſured and iudged by the conference of the demaunde and aunſwere: And touching the laſt point of the obiection, that the reuelation which a priuate man ſayth he hath of the ſpirite of God, is to hym as a grounde of religion: that is without the ſenſe &amp; wordes of our aunſwere, which ſtretched onely to laye the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true religion vpon the doctrine of the Prophetes and Apoſtles: of whoſe truth all the church generally, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particuler member of the ſame, are aſſured by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and inwarde reuelation of the ſpirite of God.</p>
               <p>Queſtion.</p>
               <p>All that is here ſpoken, muſt be added to the other aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere afore it be good: and it ſéemes that the aunſwere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes but matter of mockerie: For it is moſt certaine, that when all truth is in the doctrine of one man, he is no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12892:10"/>
more wicked or an heretike: But we ſearch ſtill the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of truth, and what it ought to be: And touching the replye, denying that the particuler reuelation is the ground of religion, there is no great difference: For if the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler reuelation be a ſufficient grounde for euery one to know that which is of the Apoſtles and Prophets, it is by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the foundation of religion, as being the grounde to know vpon what euerie particuler man knoweth and ſayth his religion is founded.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>We framed our aunſweres according to the nature and maner of the demaunds, by which appeares no likelihoode of diſpoſition to ſcoffe or ieſt: ſéeing that in ſuch a conference as this is, where is queſtion to ſearche the honor and glory of God, mockerie could not be without impietie: But touching reuelation to be like to the ſcripture (which is the grounde of religion) we denie it, and affirme them to be things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, notwithſtanding their coniunction, as following one an other, according as it is written in <hi>Eſay: Beholde my allyance with them, ſayth the Lorde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap 59. &amp;. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>my ſpirite which is in thee, &amp; the wordes which I haue breathed into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy lippes, nor from the mouth of thy ſeede,</hi> and ſo as followeth: by which maye be iudged the diſtinction that the Prophet vſeth betwéene the reuelation of the holy ſpirite, and the worde.</p>
               <p>Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I leaue (for concluſion of this conference) euerye one to iudge of the conueniencie or agréement of the aunſweres and obiections. And touching the wordes alledged out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> of the vnitie of the worde and holy ſpirite, they be but ſpéeches without purpoſe, and newe matter: neyther ought we to compare the reuelation of euerye particuler man (which was the queſtion) with that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> who had the other proofes that the holy ghoſt ſpake by him, and made demonſtration thereof many times. Laſtly, what ſoeuer is alledged, I leaue to the iudgement of euerye chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:11"/>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo alſo we referre to iudgement what hath béene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred mutuallie of the one &amp; other part: And touching the place of <hi>Eſay,</hi> which we produced, there is no queſtion at all of the reuelation of the Prophet, nor the ſpirite that was communicated to hym, but onely of the ſpirite and wordes which God promiſed to all his people, with whome he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his alliance. For the other proofes pretended, that the Prophete had of his vocation, we make no doubt at all of them, onely we proteſt that to be principall and moſt aſſured which he had by the teſtimonie of Gods ſpirite, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the ſixt Chapter of his prophecie.</p>
               <p>Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Be it that he ſpake to his people by the perſon of <hi>Eſay,</hi> yet it followes not, but that he ſpake firſt to <hi>Eſay,</hi> neyther doe I denie that he promiſed not his ſpirite to his people, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his vniuerſall Church, not that he would that euery one, yea being in thys church might vſurpe or vaunt to haue this ſpirite promiſed particulerly: And touching the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler inſpiration of <hi>Eſay,</hi> it was not founded onely on his fancie and preſumption, but in the aſſuraunce which God gaue him in ſupernaturall woorkes, as is witneſſed in hys ſixt chapter: Beſides, it was not ſufficiently grounded to be beléeued, as to haue an inſpiration, if he had not declared it by other effects and propheſies which hapned, as belonges to euerie Prophete to doe afore he beléeued.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> But referring all theſe things as matters fetched from farre, and out of the firſt propoſition, I leaue the iudgement as before.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>There is not one of the church, if he be a true member of the ſame, to whome the ſpirite of God is not communicated according to the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle <hi>Paule,</hi> and alſo the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Catholike.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.9. Chap. 2.20.27.</note> For the preſumption pretended, there is great difference betwéene preſumption and the imaginations of the ſpirite of man (which is but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12892:11"/>
darkneſſe, and of himſelfe knoweth nothing in the things of God) and the Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the holy ſpirite, which are moſt certaine, and of no leſſe aſſurance. And ſo laſtly touching our Anſweres to be out of the firſt matter or ſpéeche. If they be ſo, ſo alſo are the Demaundes.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion is, whether euery one ought to be belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſaying he hath a particulare Reuelation of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, without Declaration otherwayes, that there be holy Scriptures, and that there is difference betwéene the ſame: Let euery one be iudge whether the Demaundes and Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres be pertinent to this difficultie or not, like as alſo whether the one importe more credite and beléefe than the other, as the one béeing a newe Doctrine, ſhewes not any proofe more than the other, of their particular inſpiration.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>In our former Anſwers we haue declared howe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations ſuppoſed by particulare perſons, ought to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſuche meanes, as they may be diſcerned whether they be of Gods ſpirite or not. Héere Doctor <hi>Vigor</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his further ſpéeche, ſaying: that in the diſcourſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, he vnderſtoode muche matter in the myniſters Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, to be againſt the woorde of God, as where it is ſayde, that firſt the Sonne muſt be honored afore the father: which <hi>Spyna</hi> mainteined to be vndoutedly true, alleaging that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to haue his ground and authoritie on the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in the goſpel and firſt Catholike of <hi>S Iohn:</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto <hi>Vigor</hi> Replies, that in the ſaide places is not founde this woorde firſte, albeit, in reſpecte not to incident the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alleaged in the beginning of the conference, he wil for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare for the preſent, to enter into Confutation, reſeruing that charge, til the ende of al the conference.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spyna</hi> requires Doctor <hi>Vigor</hi> to coate the places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he pretendes to be contrary to the contentes of his Aunſwere: And to iuſtifie his opinion, to glorifie firſt the Sonne afore the Father, (according to the teſtimonie of the
<pb facs="tcp:12892:12"/>
textes afore noted) he preferres this reaſon grounded and drawne out of the Scriptures: we can not knowe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onleſſe we haue knowne the Sonne: we can not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Father, onleſſe we haue knowne him: by which the conſequence foloweth, that the knowledge and glorie of the Sonne, is a degree to come to the knowledge and glorie of the Father: which being referred by <hi>Vigor</hi> to be more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie debated in the concluſion of the whole conference, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was alſo content.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vigor</hi> Obiectes, without entring further into this diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that by the ſelfe ſame reaſon inferred by <hi>Spina,</hi> it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that we muſt honoure the Father afore the Sonne: for by the Father we come to the knowledge of the Sonne, as appeareth by the woordes of our Lord to <hi>S. Peter, <hi>Caro &amp; ſanguis no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuelauit tibi: ſed pater meꝰ qui in coelis est:</hi>
                  </hi> The ſame aduouching manifeſtly that the heauenly Father reuealed to <hi>S Peter,</hi> that our Lord was the Sonne of the liuing God: Whereupon <hi>Vigor</hi> argues in this ſorte, whether the reaſon of <hi>Spina</hi> be vaileable: by the Father we knowe the Sonne, therefore muſte we firſte honoure the Father afore the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Aunſvvere.</p>
               <p>To followe the order of the knowledge which we oughte to haue of Ieſus Chriſte and his Father propouned to vs in <hi>S Iohn,</hi> we muſt begin by the Sonne, and from the Sonne to the Father. For <hi>S. Philip</hi> deſiring him once to ſhew to him and his companions his Father: He anſwered, <hi>Philip,</hi> who hath ſeene me, hath alſo ſéene my Father, the ſame teaching that the meane to come to the knowledge of the Father, is a former knoweledge of the Sonne: which may be alſo approued by the Authorities of other places, where Ieſus Chriſte ſaithe, that none knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and he to whome the Sonne wil reueale him: And to aunſweare the Authoritie of <hi>S Mathewe</hi> alledged by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, Spina</hi> ſaithe, that the place by him produced, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no mention of the knowledge of the Father, nor the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12892:12"/>
meane to come thereunto, but only of the Reuelation which was made by the grace of God and his holy ſpirite to <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and his other companions to know Ieſus Chriſt, and in him, his Father.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Vigor</hi> calles vppon the iudgemente of the Auditorie, whether this be an Anſwere to his Obiection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing notwithſtanding till an other conference, to handle this pointe more largely (if he wil mainteine it) as not now to incident that which hath bene proponed, whereunto <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> conſentes: <hi>Vigor</hi> addes further vpon an Anſwere made by <hi>Spina,</hi> where he vſed a difference betweene the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine by the Lorde to a particulare man, and the holy Scripture, in which Aunſwere he ſeemes to put a maruell, the rather for that there is no Faithe giuen to holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only that the Lorde is the Author thereof, who can not lie: euen ſo if a particular man be aſſured that a Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made to him by the Lord, or that a perſone be aſſured of the Reuelation made to an other, be bound aſmuch to giue faith to the Reuelation, as to the ſcripture, the which matter alſo he will not (as he may) amplie handle and deduce, but falles eftſoones vpon the firſt Queſtion, which as yet hathe not bene reſolued, to the which he prayes <hi>Spina</hi> to aduaunce and prepare himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of <hi>Vigors</hi> maruell touching the Reuelation of the Lorde, and the woorde, to be thinges differing, produced in one of <hi>Spinas</hi> Anſweres, moues, in that he conceiues not the ſenſe and meaning of the ſpéeche: For <hi>Spina</hi> wil not put a difference touching the certaintie betweene the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of the Lorde, and the woorde, whiche proceeding from him, is no leſſe true than the Reuelation, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of <hi>Reciprocal:</hi> Faithe with the woorde, and yet it followes not for all that, that the woorde and Reuelations of Goddes ſpirite, (by whiche we may be ledde to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the woorde) be not things differente, and that the one goeth not afore the other. And touching <hi>Vigors</hi> requeſt to prepare to the pointe, he Aunſwereth that he can
<pb facs="tcp:12892:13"/>
not frame or draw his Anſwers from other grounde, than the Demaundes that are made him.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Vigor</hi> Replied, that touching the ſenſe, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him ſelfe vpon the contentes of <hi>Spinas</hi> Aunſwere: And where he ſaithe that the woorde goeth afore the Reuelation, that deſerues not to ſet a difference vppon the queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouned. And touching the matter of the pointe, <hi>Vigor</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, if a perſone may be aſſured that he hath the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Lord, or that a Booke be a Booke of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and when he may iudge aſſuredly of his inwarde inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And laſtly how he may aſſertaine any of this inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>The firſt Article of the laſt demaunde, is not a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to diſtinguiſhe the ſcripture from the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame: ſeeing they are matters diuers, and ſundry giftes of the Lord. And to anſwer that part of the demaund, how a particulare man, hauing in his heart the Reuelation and inwarde witneſſe of Gods ſpirite, may knowe that it is Canonical, the ſpirite of God is not different of him ſelfe, and abiding in a particular man, he ſhall alwayes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Scripture that comes of him, and which beares his markes: And touching the ſecond demaund, we ſay alſo that the ſame ſpirite being in a third man, ſhal acknowledge that aſwell the woorde, as the Reuelation are of him by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alledged, that is, that Gods ſpirite in diuers perſones, is alwayes equal and like to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>This dothe not ſatiſfie the firſte Queſtion proponed, which conteined a demaunde how any man can iudge in him ſelfe that he hath the holy ſpirit, to diſcerne and iudge a boke to be of the holy Scripture, and an other not to be but <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall,</hi> and laſtly how he can make demonſtration to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he is poſſeſſed with this inſpiration of God.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>The ſpirite of God is called a ſeale in the Scripture, for that the firſte effecte he bringes forthe in the heart of him to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12892:13"/>
whom he is communicated, is, to aſſure him of his preſence: And to aſſure a ſecond of the Reuelation, which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of Gods ſpirite, it is alſo eaſie, for that the ſpirite of God, which openeth the mouth of one to ſpeake, openeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the eares of an other to heare his woorde, the heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue him, and himſelfe to perſuade it, ſo that betwéene the maiſter and diſciple, the Doctor and the hearer, being bothe furniſhed and lightened by Gods ſpirite, there is alſo a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall concorde to knowe one an other.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>Suche a certaintie is a great incertaintie, neither is there any, of what ſecte ſo euer he be, who doth not aſſure him ſelfe to haue the holy ſpirite and truthe of his ſide, which is a fond preſumption: howe may a man diſtinguiſhe a preſumption from a true inſpiration.</p>
               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.

               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>This is no Aunſwere to the Demaunde, for there is no Queſtion to examine the doctrine by the woord, but to know that it be the woorde of God, by whiche we wil examine the doctrine, and approue it: and how a man ſhall iudge aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he hath a Reuelation of the Lord, and that it be Gods woorde.</p>

               <p>If he be one of the faithfull, he may iudge by Gods ſpirite that is in him, as in him that telles it him.

things that are of God.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>This Aunſwere is yet inſufficient to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, wherof let the iudgement reſt among the hearers and Readers: But now wée put foorth an other demaund, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee are certaine by Gods woorde, that the Lord aſſiſtes his Churche, and will aſſiſte it vntill the conſummation of the worlde. And whether there be not more aſſurance to ſtaie vpon the conſentes, and iudgement of the Church tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the determination of the Canonical Bookes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and the diſtinction of the ſame from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall, than to reſt vpon ſingular iudgement, eſteeming it to be an inwarde inſpiration, of the whiche there can be no proofe made, but only by opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee haue the holy ſprite.</p>

               <p>The Doctors confuſe the opinions of the fantaſtical ſort, with the teſtimonies, and Reuelations of the Holy Sprite, notwithſtanding there is aſmuch diſtinction betwene them two, as from heauen to earth: And touching the conſente of the Churche, ſuppoſed to procéede of the Sprite of God, it is infallible, and of no leſſe certaintie, than the particulare Reuelations of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and other Prophetes: And becauſe both the one and the other procéede of one Authour (whiche is the Sprite of Truth) the certeintie of the Reuelations of Gods Sprite, made to al the Church in generall, &amp; to euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member of the ſame, conteine one ſelf poyſe, &amp; weight.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters cannot conceale from the Catholikes, or others, but that they are fantaſtike, as making no proofe of the Reuelation of the Holy Sprite made to them, no more than other ſectes doo: And touching that pointe, ſuppoſed that it proceedes of Gods ſprit, they ſeeme to dout of the aſſiſtance of the Holy ſprite in Gods Church: which (as <hi>S Paule</hi> ſaith) <hi>Est columna,</hi>

               <p>If the Miniſters may be thoughte fantaſticke, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they haue Gods woorde, with better proofe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors maie be holden ſuch, in matters which they mainteine and defende both without &amp; againſt Gods woorde: touching the ſeconde pointe, reprouing the Miniſters that they dout of the aſſiſtaunce of the ſprite of God to the Church, your aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, that the dout is not there, but to know which is the true Church: For the third point, where the Doctors allege that it maie be inferred, that particular menne cannot erre, the conſequence is nothing woorthe, bicauſe the Sprite of God maye ſommetime departe from menne, in whiche caſe they maye faile and erre, as <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.</note> did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him.

compariſon of two Reuelations of the ſpirite, the one made to the body, and the other to the members, which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be of equal value touching the certaintie: and in the confeſſion is mention made of the Reuelation of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which cauſeth the conſent of the Churche, which folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereof, as the effecte. And if it be ſo, that the cauſe being preferred afore his effect, there is greate reaſon that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of the ſpirite of God, compared with the conſent of the Churche, ſhould be preferred afore it, as the cauſe to the effect which it produceth. And touching the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie which they pretend in Confeſſions Printed in diuers ſeaſons, and by ſundrie Printers, they ſhall be Aunſwered, when their pleaſure is to debate the Articles particularly.</p>
               <p>Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Where they made a doubt of the true Church, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like may be ſaid of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Reuelations prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Gods ſpirit to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, whom alſo we may dout whether they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church or not: Touching the other point, where they denie to impugne the fourthe Article of their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there ſéemes no ſmall contradiction, as comparing the particular Reuelation with the conſent of the church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their Aunſwere: it ſéemes alſo to ſerue to ſmall purpoſe, where they alledge the Reuelation to be the cauſe of the conſent, preferring it afore the ſame, as the cauſe afore the effecte, the ſame ſéeming as who ſhould ſay, the Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be preferred afore the word of God and holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it is moſte certaine that the Reuelation goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the woorde and ſcripture. And as it appeares in the texte of the Confeſſion (which may be eaſily iudged) the Authors of the ſame ſpeake of the certaintie and infallibilitie of two Reuelations, as holding themſelues more aſſured of that they haue in their ſpirite, than that which is of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the churche: Touching the other pointe, that particulare men may ſometimes faile, when Gods ſpirite leaues them, we may conclude by that we ought not to reſt infallibly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inſpirations pretended of particulare men, bicauſe it may be douted whether they be forſaken of Gods ſpirite or

not, which we can not do of the Church, therefore it is more aſſured to ſtay vpon the Churche infallibly gouerned by the holy ſpirite, than vpon the priuate pretended inſpirations, which the Catholikes do, not folowing their priuate iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therfore can not be eſtéemed fantaſtike: but rather ſuch are guiltie of that name, who prefer their proper iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they couer with the title of particulare inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Doctors require a texte of the Scripture, by the which the holy ſpirite is promiſed to euery particulare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to the vniuerſal church, therby to know how to iudge and diſcerne what be the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Aunſvvere.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt pointe, as in déede we do not approue all churches to be true, which are ſo ſaid, euen ſo we allowe not for faithfull, ſuche as vaunt them ſelues to be ſo: For the ſecond, the compariſon of the Doctoures is improper in this pointe, as who ſhould ſay the Reuelation is to be preferred afore the woorde of God. &amp;c. Bicauſe Gods worde and all the writings aſwel of the Prophetes as Apoſtles, are as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reuelations of Gods ſpirite, and that betweene the one and the other, there is no more difference, than betweene <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies:</hi> Touching the Article, that the Reuelation goeth before the ſcripture, we muſte diſtinguiſhe betwéene the Reuelations made to the Prophets before they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to writing, and thoſe which are made to them, that read their writings to vnderſtande them: For the firſt, we confeſſe they goe before the ſcripture, and for the ſeconde we ſay they folowe it: Touching the third Article, the miniſters Aunſwere, that it is eaſie to iudge whether Gods ſpirite aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a particulare man, or whether he be drawne from him, by the matters he propoundes, when they be conferred with Gods woorde, and cenſured by the rules of the ſame, as is ſaide.</p>

               <p>Touching the Article declaring howe we may knowe a Reuelation to be of God, which the miniſters hold, is rather diſcerned by the woorde, then by the conſente of many, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles nothing the purpoſe of the Doctors: For the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, howe a man may iudge a Booke to containe Goddes woorde, and not to iudge the Doctrine by the woorde already receiued, to which the Doctoures deſire, and the Miniſters make requeſt, that directly to the pointe, they mighte dreſſe their Aunſweres.</p>
               <p>Touching where they ſaide, of the conſent of many, the Doctoures phraſe was not ſo, but ſpake of the conſent of the Churche, which is as infallible as Gods woorde: for as it is certaine that the holy Spirite is author of the woorde, ſo is it no leſſe ſure, that he is the ſoule of the Churche, by whoſe guide, ſhee can neuer erre, according to the witneſſe of <hi>S.

ſince the Churche was planted after the deathe of Chriſte, that ſhée hathe béene in leſſe number, than the ſectes of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: neither dothe it ſerue to this purpoſe that hathe bene alleaged of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of the time of the old Teſtament, for there is greate difference betweene the Sinagoge of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the Churche, which as it is a congregation of all nations beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſte: ſo it can not but ſtande and conſiſte in moſte great multitude, for otherwayes the promiſes made to the Churche of the Gentiles ſhoulde be vaine: For it is ſaide to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his ſeede (we muſt not meane of the fleſhe) ſhould be multiplied as the Starres of heauen, or ſande of the Sea.</p>
               <p>To the Article that beginnes, <hi>touching the Prophets. &amp;c.</hi> the Doctoures ſay and confeſſe that there is great difference betwéene fantaſticall imaginations, and Reuelation of the holy Spirite. But the Miniſters Aunſwere not, howe they woulde proue their particulare perſuaſions to be rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, then vaine and fonde imaginations of Prophets, whereof <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpeakes: which notwithſtanding they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inſpirations, as alſo what they ſaide and preached, they called it the woorde of God.</p>
               <p>To the Article which beginnes, <hi>touching Anabaptiſtes. &amp;c</hi> the Doctoures Aunſwer, that to one ende the Miniſters and Anabaptiſtes produce ſelfe places, whereof mention is made, as the better to aſſure their Doctrine to be of God, bicauſe they haue a particulare Reuelation, as God hathe promiſed them by his Prophetes: For which ſelfe cauſe the Miniſters haue broughte in the ſaide Teſtimonies of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to proue that euery Faithfull man, may iudge by his particulare inſpiration, if a Booke containe the woorde of God, with Diſtinction of the Canonicall from the Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, and ſo diſcerne the true Doctrine from the falſe, which is the very grounde of the Anabaptiſtes and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</p>
               <p>To the Article beginning, <hi>touching that which is produced of Brentius, &amp;c,</hi> the Doctors alleage that the miniſters haue not vnderſtande their intent: For they bring not in the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Touching the Article folowing, the Doctoures ſay, that certaine times there were, that ſome men doubted of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bookes of Scripture, as the Apocalips and Canonicall Epiſtles of S. Iohn, with others: Albeit which time, and of common conſent, the Churche (led and guided by the holy Ghoſte) hathe receiued indifferently for Canonicall, all the Bookes that be in the Bible, which conſent continued by ſo many hundred yeares, had more authoritie than the ſaying of one or two, who notwithſtanding ſpake not but of their owne time. Beſides, there is no compariſon at all, betwéene the ſaying of one or two particulare men, and the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Councels, and conſent of the Church, as is ſaide: it will be founde alſo, that <hi>S.

Touching the Councell of <hi>Laodicen,</hi> they take it as it is, albeit it may be they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, naming one Councel for an other. And for the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle beginning, <hi>touching the experience, &amp;c,</hi> albeit it be a Queſtion <hi>de facto</hi> yet it can not be but of ſpecial value, which if it be founde as the Doctoures haue propouned (whereof they doubt not) the grounde of their particulare Reuelation is pluckt downe and confounded.</p>
               <p>Touching the concluſion of the Miniſters, the Doctoures declare that many times they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained, that matters were incidented: laying themſelues vpon the iudgement of euery one, that their laſt Reſolution was drawne in one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line, handling one ſelfe matter, withoute varying, in which notwithſtanding, if there had bene found any matter of difficultie, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters had deſired to proceede to the conference of the principal points, they could eaſily haue cleared the ſaid difficultie, the Doctors wold haue enlarged

further matter, of theſe Articles, ſauing that to enforce and haſten the buſineſſe for the whiche they are called, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to multiplie ſpeache.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters alleage that they receiue the xxiiij. Bookes of the Olde Teſtamente, with al thoſe of the New, the Doctors ſaie, that is ſmal reſpecte of matter: For al the conference whiche hitherunto they haue made, as by what Rules a man might diſcerne one Booke from an other, with iudgemente whether they were of Scripture or not, was to bring them to this point, that they receiued them by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Churche, who as ſhée is the iudge of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Bookes: And that by the ſame meane, when was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the vnderſtanding of Goddes woorde (yea in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the places of the ſame Scripture) the Miniſters &amp; Doctors might haue ſuch reuerence to the vniuerſal church, that ſhée mighte be acceſſed on bothe partes, as iudge of the vnderſtanding of Scripture, whiche they woulde acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to haue receiued of her, and whereof ſhée is infallible, &amp; more certaine iudge than either the one or other: Al which notwithſtanding the Doctors offer to the Miniſters, not to inferre for that time other Bookes than ſuch as they receiue for Canonical: only when they ſhal fall into difficultie of the interpretation of any text, or the conference of many, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors accompte it more reaſonable to haue recourſe to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal Churche and Auncient Fathers, than to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per iudgements, or fanſies of the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Aunſvvere.</p>
               <p>For concluſion, the Miniſters conſente to the offer of the Doctors, to decide the pointes and Articles of their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Bookes Canonical agreed vpon betwéene them, as the xxiiij. Bookes of the Hebrewes, and all thoſe of the Newe Teſtamente, proteſting notwithſtanding that in the laſt writing proponed by the Doctors, there be many things whiche they approue not in any ſorte, and whiche they hope to reuerſe by Confutation when the occaſion ſhall moue, whiche they had preſently done, were not theire intente to ſhewe (contrary to the imputation of the Doctors) that they

               <p>Replie.</p>
               <p>The Doctours Reciprocally agrée with the Miniſters to the offer aforeſaid with modification to adde (for their parts) the authoritie of the vniuerſall Church and ancient Doctors for the interpretation and vnderſtanding of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, when they differ or cannot agrée.</p>

               <p>The Miniſters doo further affirme, that the reaſon and principall cauſe of the Faithe, which Chriſtians adde to this Créed, is the knowledge they haue, that it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure woord of God, and he that teacheth it, mainteines alſo that it is Gods woorde, the ſame appearing by the teſtimony and writing of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> who, after he hath proponed to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the Deathe, Buriall, and Reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſte, whiche be the principall Articles of the Créede, as vpon whiche alſo our iuſtification is chiefely founded: Addeth this ſpeache, that he hathe geuen them that whiche he hathe receiued, whiche is, that Chriſte is deade for our ſinnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures: and after that he was buried,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12892:30"/>
and is riſen againe the thirde daye, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>Chriſte him ſelfe alſo, propoſing in like ſorte his Deathe,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> and Reſurrection to his twoo Diſciples, alleageth to them the Scriptures for their more aſſurance, ſaying: Oh fonde &amp; weake of hart to beleue all things that the Prophets haue pronounced: was it not méete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt ſuffred theſe things, and that he entred into his glorie: then beginning at <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the other Prophetes, he declared to them in all the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures the things that were of him ſelfe. In the ſame cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, appearing to them after his Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea afore the créede was made, ſpeaking to them of his death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for their better aſſuraunce, he laies vnto them the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſaying, It is ſo written, and it was méete that Chriſt ſuffred and riſe from death the third day, by which wée maie inferre, that for the grounde of Faithe, and aſſurance of the Articles of the ſame, there is no better meane than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And albeit in the tyme of the Natiuitie of the Churche, the Créede was proponed to ſuche as were Catechiſed, afore the Apoſtles or Euangeliſtes had ſette downe any thing in writing, yet it foloweth not for all that, that there were not other ſcriptures vppon which mighte be founded euery Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faithe: Whiche to decypher by péecemeale, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Creation hathe his fundation vppon the beginning of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> The Article of the Almightineſſe of God hathe his grounde vppon the <hi>40.</hi> of <hi>Eſaie,</hi> and many other places of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>The Article of the Conception of Ieſus Chriſte, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the vij. of <hi>Eſay:</hi> For the place of his Natiuitie, vppon the v. of <hi>Micheas,</hi> and for the Regarde of the Time, vppon the xlix. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and ix. of <hi>Daniel:</hi> The Article of his death &amp; the Croſſe, vpon the xxij. <hi>Pſalme:</hi> xxxv. of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and ix. of <hi>Daniel:</hi> The Article of Reſurrection, vppon the xvj. <hi>Pſalme:</hi> the Article of Aſcenſion, vppon the xcviij. <hi>Pſalme:</hi> the Article of the Iudgemente, in <hi>Daniel</hi> xij. the Article of his ſending the holy ghoſt, in <hi>Ioel</hi> ij. the Article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church

               <p>It maie appeare to euery one by the places here inferred, that there were cleare and euidente Scriptures, to grounde all the Articles of Faithe, afore the Créede was beſtowed in writing, whiche might and oughte to be exhibited to ſuche as were Catechiſed, for their aſſurance in that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to beleue: Neither is it poſſible that a man may beleue, if firſt he haue not vnderſtand and hearde the woord, and that he aſſure hime ſelf of it, and hold it as certaine (and more if it were poſſible) than the matters conceiued, and comprehended by Mathematicall demonſtrations, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the definition of the Faith, when the Apoſtles calles it <hi>Hypoſtaſin</hi> and <hi>Eleuchon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr 12.</note> whiche is, ſubſiſtance of things whiche we ſée not. The Miniſters alſo ſaie, that to call the Créede a Doctrine not written, and in the meane while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the Apoſtles wrote it, is to implie contradiction: Neither can it be ſhewed howe longe it hath bene a doctrine not written, nor ſince when it hath begonne to be written: And greatly doo the Miniſters greue, that they who conferre with them, doo not more laboure in the edifying aſwell of ſuch as aſſiſte the conference, as others to whoſe viewe and reading the actes may come. For where they might handle and decide pointes tending to edifie the ignorante, they ſtaie vpon the queſtion of others wherein is no doubt at al: The ſame being no more than to proue a thing already confeſſed and reſolued, and lighte a Candle at noone dayes. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them ſelues, that ſuche as ſhall reade the actes of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference, wil not maruel to ſée them decline from the point wherein they haue bene ſo much required, bicauſe (as Chriſt ſaithe) He that doothe euil, fleeth the lighte.</p>
               <p>For concluſion, the Miniſters proteſte to confeſſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that the Symbol of the Apoſtles in euery Article is the pure woorde of God, and that in the faithe of the ſame it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth euery faithefull man to ſtande and perſeuer vntill the ende: So that for their partes, they will in no ſorte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

               <p>The Doctours wil proue, that the Doctrine of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters conteineth pointes, contrary to the principall Articles of the Creede: As firſte, againſt the Article of Goddes Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, when they ſay and teach that God cannot make that one Body be in twoo places: The ſeconde againſte the Article of Creation, wherein they ſaie, that not onely God ſuffereth that euill and ſinne be committed, but alſo dothe it him ſelfe: The thirde, ſometimes they denie, and earſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe for an Article of Faithe, that the Virgyn Mary ſhould remaine a Virgyn after her deliuery: The fourthe, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte is not deſcended into Hell but by imagination, and not Really: Yea moreouer, againſte the ſaide Article they ſaie, that Ieſus Chriſte diſpaired of his ſaluation (vpon the trée of the Croſſe) as being troubled in his conſcience with feare to be damned: with many other errours contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Article.

according to the whiche, the Miniſters oughte to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere touching the errors conteined in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine preached by them, againſte the Articles of the creede, as the Doctours haue noted and propoſed them, &amp; to enter immediately into the matter, they affirme, that the Miniſters haue euill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged <hi>S.

Further the Doctoures demaund vpon the Article of the Omnipotencie (whiche is the fundation of the Supper and the Sacramente) why in a confeſſion proponed at <hi>Poisſie</hi> before the King by <hi>Beza,</hi> and after him other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and beſtowed in diuerſe Bookes, is not conteined the article of the Omnipotencie, which is the firſte and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Article of Faithe, and why they haue made ſo many different confeſſions of Faithe, taking awaye that they haue putte in the one, and (of the contrarye) adding what they haue omitted in the others: And howe this Article of the Trinitie is not expreſſely in the firſte confeſſion, 1564. which they confeſſe, albeit moſte darkely.</p>
               <p>Aunſvvere.</p>
               <p>It appeares by the actes of the laſte dayes conference, that the demaunde of the Miniſters was in nature the ſelfe Requeſte they preſently make, whiche is, that the pointe of the Maſſe mighte be firſte decided, as being the chiefe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the conference.</p>
               <p>And for that they propone touching the Symboll, the Miniſters neuer doubted, nor yet ſuſpecte, but that it is a pure Apoſtolicall Doctrine, whiche lies to all mennes view in reading the actes of the ſaide dayes Diſputation, where, in halfe a doſen places at the leaſte, they haue alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed &amp; repeated the ſame: The only thing, they mainteined to be in dout, is, whether the Creede was written by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles or not, wherein thei can nothing be verefied, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the Doctors: and <hi>S.

               <p>Touching the differences whiche the Doctours pretende to be in the confeſſions of the refourmed Churches, imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and publiſhed in diuerſe Temples, the Miniſters denie to differ one from an other in reſpect of the ſenſe, albeit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome tearmes maie be changed for a more large decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and where they allege that in ſome of them the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Gods almightineſſe hathe bene omitted, the Miniſters denie it, requiring the Doctours to produce the exemplarye of the confeſſion, wherein they ſaie it is omitted, ſéeing if it ſhould be ſo it might be falſified &amp; corrupted: They ſay that in their confeſſion there is nothing either ambiguous or darke, which ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaide Doctors haue wel ſhewed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue dreſſed a forme of confeſſion vpon the Patron of thoſe of the refourmed Churches, vſing proper termes and ſentences: whereunto they haue added nothing to make it diuerſe, but that which they haue in difference with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters &amp; that they could hardly grounde vpon the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>The Doctours ſay, the Miniſters conceale no whit their boldneſſe to deny things that are manifeſt, as the opinion of <hi>S.

writing ſhalbe readde: wherein for their better grounde of this denial, they reſt vpon a very ſmall reaſon, which is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Article of deſcending into Hell, whether it was brought in by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, or added by others, as from thence to call againe into doubte, whether they be Authours of all the other Articles: The ſame reſembling as if it were ſaid, that it is incertaine, whether <hi>S.

               <p>Aunſwere.</p>
               <p>All theſe queſtions are impertinent, &amp; eſtranged from the confeſſion of the churches, &amp; yet the doctors haue choſen it for the fundation of al the conference, in which reſpecte, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters require pertinent diſputation, &amp; that they chuſe one Article or more of the ſaid confeſſion, vpon which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to pitche the ground of the ſaide Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Obiection.</p>
               <p>Theſe queſtions are very pertinent to impugne the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Miniſters confeſſion: for there is no queſtion of the proper woordes conteined in the ſame confeſſion, which is no other thing than a ſumme of the Faithe: But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours ſeeme to impugne the ſenſe of the articles which they knowe by theire proper writings, by whiche they make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the teſtimonie, that touching the Article of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie God cannot bring to paſſe the things aforeſaide: The Doctoures alſo ſhewe, that it is directely to impugne the Doctrine of Heretikes, and the true meane to proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that they receiue not the holy Scripture when it is proued, they comprehend not the true ſenſe of it: They

alſo ſay that euen the Miniſters themſelues be the cauſes of ſuche Queſtions, hauing deſired to conferre of the Maſſe, by which meane the Doctoures woulde make them come to it: For the Article of the omnipotencie, is the principall ground to proue and ſuſtaine Gods woord, and the Reall preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſte in the Sacrament of the Aultare, maruelling much of much declining, conſidering that when there is ſpeeche of their Confeſſion they demaund the Maſſe, and when the Maſſe is offred, they require their Confeſſion.</p>

               <p>The miniſters maruell muche of ſo muche ſuperfluous matter proponed by the Doctoures: And where they ſay that albeit they impugne not the termes of the ſaide Confeſſion, yet they reſiſte the ſenſe, the miniſters Aunſwere that the ſenſe can not be knowne but by the termes, by which reaſon they wrap themſelues in a contradiction, when in leauing the termes, they ſay they will confute the ſenſe: Touching the Concluſion, affirming that one body at one ſelfe inſtante may be in diuers places, the Miniſters denie in good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that that can not be inferred of the omnipotencie of God.</p>

               <p>The Miniſters denie the conſequence aforeſaide, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage the reaſon, as that it appeares by the holy Scripture, that God can not denie him ſelfe,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>And a little after, he affirmes that God can not ſinne, as being a thing farre from his nature: And ſo concludes, that albeit there be many things which he can not doe (ſeeing there be many ſinnes) that yet for all that he forbeares not to be omnipotent.</p>

               <p>The Doctors finde in the reaſons aforeſaid a Confeſſion of the antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which ſhuld ſeeme to be only ſuppoſed, God could not bring to paſſe that one body at one ſeaſon ſhoulde be in two places, no more than he is able to do the things by them alleaged: for they alleage them to this ende, to ſhewe that there be ſomethings which God can not do, which they can not applie to the preſent Queſtion (that one bodie can not vſe two places) without Declaration y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is impoſſible to God.

But in the Queſtion propoſed, there is nothing like, which only Demaundes, if God by his power can alter and chaunge the Nature and qualitie of things created: as if he could bring to paſſe, that a heauie thing abiding in his qualitie of heauineſſe &amp; waighte (which naturally weighes downewarde) ſhoulde remaine by the onely vertue of God, hanging on high, as we reade in the holy Scripture, that the fire which naturally aſcendes and ſtretches on heigthe, diſcendes downewarde by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God, and alſo that fire of his proper nature ardente and burning, makes cold (his owne qualitie that is the heat) reaſting in the ſubſtance: as alſo that two bodyes may be in one place, as appeareth when our Lord entred where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were, the doores being ſhut: or that a great and large bodie remaining in his groſeneſſe and bigneſſe, paſſeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a place inequall to his greatneſſe and largeneſſe as the Camell thorow the eie of a needell. All which Examples, as they are taken of the ſcripture, ſo if it muſte be that God can not bring to paſſe that one body be in two places, he can no more doe the things aforeſaide, by the reaſons which ſhall be deduced héereafter to that ende.

of the Incarnation of our Lord, ſaith generally there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſſible to God, as touching his creatures: But is it ſo that the generalitie of an argument is deſerued, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular exceptions, and made vnprofitable and without force by that meane: When God then alleageth generally, that his power can doe it, it may be doubted of, and thought that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things proponed of God, may be of thoſe that are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him: aſwel as the exceptions alleaged of the miniſters: And that alſo ſhould be falſe which the Aungell ſaithe, that there is nothing impoſſible to god, by that, that many things are alleaged and proponed to the contrarie: So that to the ende God and his Aungelles, be mainteined true in their woordes, we muſte not doubte that he can not chaunge and tranſforme his creatures and al their qualities muche more eaſily, than a potter is able to worke his clay, and fourme at his pleaſure any veſſell thereof.</p>
               <p>Further, if we limite the power of God towards his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is daunger, that we fal not to deny him his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and dominion ouer them: for to be Lord ouer a creature, is no other thing than to haue power to chaunge and alter him, and giue him ſuche a nature and qualitie, as he thinkes good, as hauing him altogether in his power: And therefore God in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> to ſhewe that he had power to reuerſe and deſtroy <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (according to his pleaſure) begins to ſay, I am Lorde ouer all fleſhe, is there any thing impoſſible to me: and therfore the Doctoures conclude, that there is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if this queſtion be mainteined as impoſſible to God, that euery one will doe as muche: alleaging the ſelfe examples that the miniſters do, to exempt from Gods power al things that diſpleaſe him. And when ſuche matter ſhall be produced out of Scripture, he may interprete the Scripture in other ſenſe, ſaying: that ſuche a thing ſhalbe impoſſible to God in the naturall ſenſe of the woordes of the Scripture, euen as the miniſters chaunge the Scripture, which ſaithe that the body of Ieſus Chriſte is in two places, that is, the woorde of the Supper compared with the woorde of the Aſcention, and they ſay, that that ſpéeche of the Supper oughte not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12892:35"/>
literally, bicauſe it is impoſſible to God that one Body be in twoo places: And ſo the Doctours ſaie, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one woulde corrupte the Literall ſenſe of the Scripture, holding that the thing is impoſſible to God, and therefore the Scripture muſte be otherwayes vnderſtande: and yet it maye ſo happen, that it is only bicauſe it doth diſpleaſe him, producing notwithſtanding the ſame reaſons and allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whiche the Miniſters doo to declare that all things are not impoſſible to God.</p>
               <p>The Doctors conclude eftſoones, that it is better to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the Scripture in his truthe, albeit ſhée propoſe things incomprehenſible and impoſſible to our iudgement, than to giue way to euery one to depraue Goddes woorde, applying it to his owne will and fanſie, vnder ſhadowe to ſaie, that it is impoſſible to God, and ſo to alleage other examples.</p>
               <p>Laſtely they will not omitte, that the Miniſters, who haue ſo déepely proteſted to reſt &amp; ſtay vpon the pure woord of God, allege not againſt Gods power but the ancient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, aiding themſelues with their authorities againſt the expreſſe woord of God, which beares, that nothing is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to him generally without ſome exception.</p>
               <p>Aunſvvere.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters aunſwere that the Doctoures proue not their conſequence, but leaue it as in a diſtruſte not to be able to confirme it, as is moſte likely: They make no mention but of the Antecedent of their conſequence, to the confeſſion of whiche it will neuer be poſſible to them to bring the Miniſters by the reaſons and authorities by them alleadged ſo ſtrengthen theire ſaide conſequence, bicauſe of a Particulare they inferre a Generall, whiche is againſte the Rules of <hi>Dialectice:</hi> where they ſaye, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities alleaged by the Miniſters, apperteine nothing to reproue their conſequence, and to ſhewe that God forbeares not to be almighty, notwithſtanding that he cannot doo any thing which derogates his nature: They referre themſelues for that, to the ancient authours aforeſaid, who for the ſame and &amp; reaſon of the miniſters alleage the ſaide exceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:36"/>Where they pretende that the Authorities and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alleaged of the Auncientes, doo nothing apperteine to the preſente queſtion, as denying that they oughte to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of other things, excepte ſuche as conteine in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues contradiction. The Miniſters aunſwere, that euen ſo doothe that whiche they propone of a Body that in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante he maye he in diuerſe places: the ſame being aſmuch as if they had ſaide, that a Bodye is, and is not at one time, and that a Body is one, and not one.</p>
               <p>And laſtely that a Creature maye be incircumſcript, and not encloſed in certaine limittes: whiche if it were ſo, he ſhoulde be no more a Creature, but a God, as maye be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the ſaying of <hi>S. Baſile</hi> in his Booke of the Holye Ghoſte, Chapter <hi>22.</hi> whoſe opinion is, that the Aungell whiche appeared to <hi>Cornelius</hi> was not in the ſelfe place where <hi>Philip</hi> was, and he whiche of the Aultare ſpake to <hi>Zacharie,</hi> did not furniſhe at the ſame time he ſpake to him, his Seate and place in Heauen: But the Holy Ghoſte is in <hi>Abacuc,</hi> and <hi>Daniell</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>Ezechiell</hi> vppon the Floudde of <hi>Chobar,</hi> for the Sprite of God repleniſheth the Earthe: wherein the Prophete crying, ſaithe, Whither ſhall I goe to hide me from thy Sprite? where ſhall I flée to decline from thy face?</p>
               <p>And <hi>Dydimus</hi> confirming this in his Booke whiche he hathe written of the Holy Ghoſte, makes this queſtion, If, ſaithe he, the Sprite of God were a Creature, he ſhoulde haue his ſubſtaunce circumſcripte and limited, as haue all other Creatures whiche are made and created: So that, as it is that Goddes Sprite repleniſhes the worlde, and is not circumſcripte in any place, nor lymited, ſo it followeth thereupon that he is God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his Diſputation whiche he wrote betwéene <hi>Sabellius, Photius, Arius,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> vnder the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> writes in this ſorte: By this it maye chiefely appeare, that the Sprite of God, is God, that he is euery where, and not conteined in any place, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete writes, whither maye I withdrawe my ſelfe to hide
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12892:36"/>
me from thy Sprite?</p>
               <p>By theſe places wée maye conclude, that if a Bodye be not circumſcripte, termined, and cloſed within certaine ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes, he coulde not be a Creature, whiche oughte not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vnderſtande by other Bodyes, but alſo euen by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte: as appeareth by <hi>Theodorete</hi> in his ſeconde Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue, ſaying, then the Body of the Lorde is riſen againe, exempte from all corruption, impaſſible and immortal, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Diuine glorie, adored &amp; woorſhipped with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial powers. And yet albeit he be in this ſort qualified, he leaues not for all that to be circumſcript, as he was afore he was glorified, whereof it foloweth, that being true Body &amp; Creature, he cannot at one inſtante be in ſundry places.</p>
               <p>Touching their allegations, that the examples aforeſaide apperteine nothing to the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proponed, bicauſe it ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not but to know if God may change the qualities into a Subſtance, the ſubſtance remaining: The Miniſters deny it, bicauſe in the Queſtion there is mention of a Bodye, whiche cannot be without his Meaſures: And the meaſures and Dimenſions be not as Qualities and Accidentes, which may come to a Body and departe from it, without that it be corrupted (which is the nature &amp; condition of Accidents) but they are of their proper Eſſence, ſo that it is impoſſible that a Body be a Body, but that he be meaſured &amp; circumſcripte.</p>
               <p>The firſt example they produce to confirme their ſaying, is, that it may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that a weighty thing, which naturally in reſpect of his heauineſſe enclines downward, may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on high, wherunto the Miniſters anſwere, that the ſame may be in déede by a viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mouing: but this example is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pertinent to reuerſe that which they haue ſaid, bicauſe ſuch things conteine no contradiction in themſelues, neither are they contrary to the eſſence of the thing where they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: for a ſtone which a man throwes on highe, leaues not for al that to be a ſtone, like as alſo by the ſame mouing it is not depriued of his weightineſſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the Example of the Fire, they aunſwere, that there is one ſelfe reaſon bothe of lighte and heauie
<pb facs="tcp:12892:37"/>
things, and that without any corruption of their Eſſence, their naturall mouings maie be chaunged by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence donne to them. Touching their allegation of the fire, which contrary to his nature that is to ſkorche and burne) refreſhed the three Iewes in the Furnace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they aunſwere, that the fire, for all that was in nothing altered, neither touching his Eſſence, nor in reſpecte of his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Whereof the proofe fell oute, in that it ſparing the ſayde thrée Children, burnte and conſumed the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures, or ſuche as had office to dreſſe it.</p>
               <p>By whiche maye be well alleaged, that why it did not offende them, procéeded not for that his nature or qualitie were in any thing chaunged, but onely bicauſe his action was ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>And where they alleage that two Bodies may be at once in one place, prouing the ſame by that whiche is written in <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that Chriſte entred where his Diſciples were, the doores being ſhutte: The Miniſters aunſwere, that it is not ſo in the Texte, but that the Diſciples being aſſembled in one place, Ieſus Chriſte ſtoode, and appeared in the middeſt of them: By which it cannot be inferred that he entred the place where they were without opening the doores, nor that he did pearce or penetrate them to make his entrie.</p>
               <p>And it is no leſſe likely true, that they were open and ſhutte againe, than the doores whiche the Aungell opened &amp; ſhutte againe,<note place="margin">Actor. 12. Actor. 5.</note> when he was ſente to deliuer <hi>S. Peter</hi> out of Priſon, and when he was likewiſe ſente for the deliuery of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And where they bring in a groſſe Body paſſing throughe a ſtraite place, alleaging the example of a Cable throughe the hole of a Néedle, the Miniſters finde it alleaged to euill pourpoſe, as an argumente founded vppon a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſaye further, that the Doctours haue euill vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the tearme of <hi>Camelos,</hi> whiche is vſurped in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not for a Cable, but for a Camell: As is manifeſte inoughe to thoſe that are but ſlenderly exerciſed in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of the Hebrewes, and as appeareth by the opinion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12892:37"/>
of <hi>Angelius Caninius,</hi> vppon the ende of his <hi>Chaldey</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Touching the concluſion, whiche the Doctors drawe of the former examples it is to euil pourpoſe, and grounded vppon the Antecedentes and premiſſes which they bring in preſuppoſed, and neither as yet confeſſed by vs, nor wil not be in the ſenſe wherein they alleage them, for the reaſons héere afore declared.</p>
               <p>Touching that which they ſay againſt the opinion of the Miniſters, that one body at one inſtante can not be in two places, yea were it the body of Ieſus Chriſt, and that it was neuer written by any the Auncientes, nor proponed afore the comming of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Theodore de Beza,</hi> the Miniſters mainteine it was aduouched afore their time, as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his Epiſtle written to <hi>Dardanus,</hi> vſing theſe termes: According to this fourme, ſaith he, (meaning the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall fourme of Ieſus Chriſt) we muſt not thinke that it is euery where, as alſo we muſt vſe good héede, that in eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing to him his Diuinitie, we take not from him the truthe of his bodie: And in an other place he ſaith, that by reaſon of the nature and meaſure of his body, he is in one place of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: <hi>Theodoretus</hi> vſing the ſelfe ſame ſpéeche or Phraſe in his ſeconde Dialogue, as hathe béene alleaged heere before: Like as alſo <hi>Vigilius</hi> in his fourthe Booke againſt <hi>Eutiches,</hi> vſeth this Queſtion, if it be but a Nature of the Worde and the Fleſhe, howe comes it that the Fleſhe is not in euery place, as the Woorde is euery where (of which Woorde the Fleſh was taken to conſtitute a perſon and <hi>Hypoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12892:38"/>
woord out of the Bookes of the Auncients.</p>
               <p>Where the Doctoures pretend, that the fourme of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſters vſe, affirming that to ſay any thing is impoſſible to God, dothe not derogate his omnipotencie: deſtroyeth the fourme of argument vſed by the Angell ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the virgine, for the confirmation of his meſſage, that nothing was impoſſible to God: the miniſters Anſwer, that that is nothing to purpoſe, bicauſe the queſtion doth neither importe a thing containing in it ſelfe any contradiction, nor that is contrary to the truthe of God. Touching the opinion of the Doctors, that God can chaunge the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of things, there is none that doubtes thereof: But when that is done, it muſt alſo be aduowed that things being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, remaine no more in their firſt nature: and the Miniſters ſay that it is not all one touching the thing héere proponed, bicauſe the Doctoures would haue a thing dwell in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and nature, notwithſtanding his eſſentiall partes be chaunged, yea and wholly extincte and aboliſhed: Touching the limitation of the power of God on the behalfe of his creatures, there is no man ſo ſenceleſſe, as to enterpriſe to limite in all reſpectes, that which he will, and that confeſſeth not, that he may ordeine and diſpoſe of all his Creatures in general as it pleſeth him, and as a potter doth of his mould, wherein their opinion runnes that the authoritie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> ought to be referred thither, as appeareth clearely by theſe Hebrue woordes, <hi>lo gippale mimiuecha col-dauar,</hi> which is, Lord, nothing ſhall be harde to thée.</p>
               <p>Touching the perill which the Doctoures pretende, may riſe of the Miniſters ſaide Aunſweres, they ſay, that people of good and ſounde iudgement, can not frame any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conſequence of it, conſidering that all this Doctrine is true, and containes no obſcuritie: but if perhappes any cull oute an euill profite of it, it is to be imputed to themſelues and their euill vnderſtanding, by which, not only any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but alſo the woorde of God it ſelfe may ſometimes be peruerted and corrupted: To be ſhort, all things (as ſayeth the Apoſtle) are cleane to thoſe that be cleane, and filthie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12892:38"/>
to ſuch as are ſo, and haue a wicked Conſcience. Where the Doctoures alleage, that there may be occaſion taken by the Doctrine aforeſaide, to interpreate the Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a ſelfe ſenſe and fanſie, the Miniſters denie it, and ſay: That if the worlde enterpriſe it, it is caſie inough to reiecte his interpretation as not correſpondente to the Rules and <hi>Analogie</hi> of Faithe, wherewith the ſayde Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and interpretation of the Miniſters dothe agrée and conſent.</p>
               <p>And where they ſay that the Miniſters chaunge and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Scripture, they Aunſwere that it is a reproche and ſlaunder not to be verified againſte them, neither touching their writings, their woordes, nor any thing by them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, either by ſpeeche or thought.</p>
               <p>Where they ſay that the Scripture is of opinion that the bodie of Ieſus Chriſte is in two places, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters denie it, and ſay, that (on the contrary) the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſtabliſheth him in heauen and not elſewhere: And Heauen muſte containe hym, vntill the time of reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all that hathe béene foreſpoken by the mouthe of his holy Prophets, from the beginning of the worlde.</p>
               <p>And where they alleage that the Scripture ought not to be interpreted according to the ſenſe and fanſie of euery one. The Miniſters confeſſe it with this Addition, that all interpretations ought to be examined as <hi>S.

               <p>And laſtly, where the Doctoures accuſe the Miniſters, to haue alleaged no place of the Scripture, before they produced the Auncientes to confirme their ſayde Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the Miniſters ſay, they are falſely impoſed, for that, if they well remember, they alleaged to the ſame ende in the beginning of their diſcourſe, the opinion of <hi>S.

                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:39"/>Which places togither with the opinions of the Auncients, were not alleaged as to diminiſhe the omnipotencie of God, but rather to eſtabliſhe it, and cut of the way to many impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and blaſphemies, which they would falſly exhibite, and couer them vnder the couler of Gods almightineſſe, without hauing regard to the will declared, to which we muſt referre the power.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctoures Obiecte, that they haue made this Argumente: God can not bring to paſſe that one body be in two places: then God is not Almightie: which conſequence how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is, is fully manifeſt without other proofe, by the lawe of contradiction: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule holden in all Schooles of Philoſophers, two contradictions can not be true: To be able to doe all things, and not able to do certaine particulare things, be contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſéeing this particulare thing is one part of the whole: So that it muſt néedes be, that if the antecedent be true, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent muſt be falſe, according to the lawe of contradiction, for both can not be true together, as things of contradiction: And albeit by the knowledge of the very termes, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may be iudged to be good, yet it may eaſily be knowne by the handling of the Obiection againſt the Anſwere of the Miniſters, that the Doctours haue proued the conſequence: This was the reaſon of the Miniſters, God can not lie nor ſinne, and can not bring to paſſe that things done, ſhould not be done, bicauſe that either it impugnes his nature, or there is repugnancie of the parte of the creatures, bicauſe there is contradiction entangled. But the Doctors affirmed in their Obiection, that there is no ſuche thing in the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12892:39"/>
which is, if one body may be in two places: whereof they make this kinde of Arguing taken of their Obiection: God can doe all things that impugne not his nature, either when there is no reſiſtance of the parte of the creatures, and that there is implied no contradiction: to affirme that a body may be in two places at one inſtant, is a thing not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the nature of God, and of the parte of the body doth implie no contradiction. Then God can do it, or elſe ſo, God cannot do it: then it foloweth that God is not almightie: in this ſorte is proponed the reaſon and deduction of the antecedent and conſequent, and alſo the proofe of the aſſumption or ſeconde prepoſition: for it is proued that there is no contradiction in ſaying that one body may be in two places, &amp; that it doth not impugne the nature of God, whereof the proofe hathe bene made by the Example of like things, as God may bring to paſſe that two bodies may be in one place, with other like reaſons, which are deduced in the Obiection.</p>
               <p>And where they ſay the Doctoures doe argue euil from a particulare to an vniuerſal, it ſeemes (vnder correction) they haue forgotten the rules of <hi>Dialectice,</hi> as being moſt certaine that this rule hathe place in the affirmatiue, and not in the negatiue: But (of the contrary) when there is any thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed generally, and the default is proued in particular (as ſay the <hi>Dialecticians) <hi>Ad negationem perticularis ſequitur ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio eius quod vniuerſaliter affirmatum est.</hi>

               <p>They are ſory to be referred to their <hi>Dialecticke,</hi> as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering none other end, than to make the antecedent graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is, that God can not bring to paſſe that one body

               <p>For the Article beginning <hi>touching the authorities, &amp;c,</hi> the Doctoures Obiecte, that the Auncientes neuer thoughts to make any exception of any thing which is not ſubiecte to the power of God: for (as it is manifeſt) he that ſaith all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth nothing, ſo, when the ſcripture ſaithe that God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, hir meaning is clear, that there is no exception: and to giue exception in this, ſhould be no leſſe to gaineſay many places of Gods woorde, than to blaſpheme his power. But the Doctoures ſay, that the Auncientes haue interpreted the omnipotencie of God not to comprehend that which toucheth the perfection of his nature, but onely that which concerneth creatures: So that there be not to manifeſt contradiction &amp; repugnancie of their parte. The preſent Queſtion importes not that there is not contradiction, that one body be a body, and that at one inſtant it be in diuers places: For of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of bodies, ſpeaking of one body hauing his dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the phraſe of the Philoſophers <hi>de predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio quantitatis,</hi> it is certaine, that the Dimenſions be of the eſſence of a body: but to be circumſcript and encloſed in a place, is accidentall: The ſame being declared by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: for the moſte high heauen according to his whole, is a body, and yet it is not in place according to his whole. And therefore it is not a thing eſſentiall to a body, to be encloſed in one place.</p>

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:12892:40"/>Wherein to ſpeake of the preſent matter, the Miniſters ſhould be muche encombred to proue that the body of Ieſus Chriſte is in one place in Heauen, ſéeing it is written in the fourthe of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he is mounted aboue all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, oute of the which there is no place, as they ſpeake of places in regarde of bodies according to nature: And if it were ſo, that it were eſſentiall to one body, to be in one place (according to the rule which the Miniſters giue) there wold followe an other blaſphemie againſte the omnipotencie of God, that God could not make one body, and beſtow it, aboue all the Heauens, and (to ſpeake more vniuerſally) that God could not make a body without place equal to his greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the Allegations proponed by the Miniſters of certaine Auncient authoures, the Doctoures Obiecte that thoſe Allegations make againſt themſelues, bicauſe, to be encloſed in one place, depends not of the eſſence of the body, nor his dimenſions, as appeareth by the Authorities produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, making mention of the Aungels who haue no bodies: it it is not then an eſſentiall reaſon, that the dimenſion of one body be contained in one place: Neither dothe all this blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment of Authorities make any thing to purpoſe, ſéeing they tend not but to ſhew that the natural propertie of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is different from the nature Diuine, as ſaithe <hi>S.

Chap. <hi>7.</hi> where the ſaide Authoures declare that God of his nature may be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere, as his creatures by their natures, not: neither doo the ſaid Authors pretend that God by his omnipotencie can not make one body to be in diuers places, ſéeing euen very they (or their like) when they come to ſpeake of the power of God in the holy ſacrament, affirme that Chriſtes body is in heauen, and in the holy Sacramente, inueighing alſo by the ſame power, that the Aungels and ſoules of the bleſſed, may be in many places, and the Doctours wil recite in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters ſaye that a Body muſte be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripte of the place according to his eſſentiall propertie: that

               <p>And touching the euaſion which the Miniſters make of a moſt ſtrong and mightie argument againſte their Doctrine, that two bodies may be in one place according to the proofe taken of the ſcripture (not only to iuſtifie that God can bring to paſſe that two bodies may be in one place, but alſo that he hath done it) ſerues for nothing to couer their erroure, as to ſay, that in <hi>S.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12892:42"/>
be ſéene and knowne of thoſe who beleued it not: So the ſame Lorde applying him ſelfe to the imbecilitie of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and to ſatiſfie the doubtes of the vnfaithefull, ſhewes a ſecrete, &amp; an acte of his Omnipotencie. Therefore expounde to me, who euer thou arte, that wilte be a ſearcher of the Omnipotencie of God, the reaſon of this facte: The Diſciples were encloſed together, and drawne into a ſecrete place: the Lorde reuealed him ſelfe to <hi>Thomas,</hi> to confirme his Faithe according to the condition he deſired, that is, to touche his body, and proue his woundes: For whiche rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and cauſe, it muſte needes be, that he bare euen that true body wherein he had receiued thoſe woundes. I aſke then, ſéeing he was Corporall, by what parte of the houſe did he thruſte or intrude him ſelfe within? For I ſee the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes opnion is plaine, that Ieſus came the doores being ſhutte, and was amidde his Diſciples: Did he penetrate the groſſe walles, or great barre of woode that was betwene bothe? It is moſte true, he entred without fiction or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite. Lette thy reaſon folowe and conſider his Entrie, and thy vnderſtanding enter into the ſhutte houſe with him: Thou ſeeſt that all is ſounde and faſte at the Locke, and yet he was in the middeſt of his Diſciples, but that is, bicauſe all things are open to him by his Omnipotencie. Thou blameſt things inuiſible, I aſke thée againe the reaſon of that thing viſible. From the Walles or Gates firme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing recules or giues place: And yet I ſee of the contrarie the woode and ſtones by their nature cannot receiue ſuche entrie. The Lordes Body was not vnmade, to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of nothing: then from whence comes it, that he was in the middeſt withoute opening the doore? The ſenſe and the woorde faile in this, and the truthe of the acte is aboue mannes reaſon, ſo that as wee are abuſed of the byrthe of the Sonne of God, ſo doo wée alſo lye of that Entrie: wée ſaie, the facte is falſe, and that it did not ſo happen, bicauſe we are not able to vnderſtande the reaſon, and bicauſe our ſenſe and iudgemente faile, wée ſaie, there was no ſuche facte:

but the Faithe &amp; beliefe of the facte conuinceth our dreame: the Lorde was amidde his Apoſtles the houſe being ſhutte, and the Sonne of God was borne of his Father: doo not denie that he entred thus, bicauſe by the infirmitie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite thou arte not able to comprehende this manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. I coulde amplifie like factes in all his creatures, but the Lord hath wel forſéene in him ſelfe, to haue vs conteined in neceſſitie and modeſtie by the nature of our bodyes: wée declare ſufficiently that we woulde be an other God, if wee had the power, and bicauſe we cannot by the audacitie of our wicked will, reuerſe the nature of truthe, at the leaſte wée gaineſaie it, and raiſe warre with the woordes of God.</p>

Mathewe 19.</hi> It is more eaſie that a Cable enter the eie of a Néedle, than a Riche man into the Kingdome of Heauen, whereunto the Miniſters haue aunſwered two things: The one, that in the inuolution we muſt not turne Cable, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Camel: notwithſtanding their own french Bible of the impreſſion of <hi>Antony Kebul,</hi> which they haue brought, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth the verſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this word Cable: like as alſo <hi>Caluin</hi> in his Harmony of the foure Euangeliſts ſaith, it is the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:45"/>Wherein may be ſéene and founde true that which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> inueigheth againſte the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte him in the firſte Booke Chap. <hi>14.</hi> that ſuche as are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from vs, to putte themſelues in an other ſchoole, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe alwayes ſome new thing, to the end the Diſciples may be founde more able than the Maiſters: But be it that the woorde of Camel is graunted to them (which the Doctoures doubte not hathe bene expounded by <hi>S. Hilarie, S. Ierome,</hi> &amp; others) the reaſon is yet ſtronger: For it is more vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and repugnante, that a crooked Camel groſſe and greate, enter the hole of a Néedle, than a Cable. The other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon giuen by the Miniſters is, that God maye bring to paſſe that a Camell or Cable enter the eie of a Néedle, whiche is notwithſtanding againſte the pure woorde of Ieſus Chriſte, whiche ſaith, It is not impoſſible to God to doo it, but rather eaſie, and by compariſon, more eaſie to God than to make a Riche man enter into the Kingdome of Heauen, whiche our Lorde ſaithe notwithſtanding to be poſſible, not to men, but to God, to whom nothing is impoſſible: whereupon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours ſaie, that if God can doo that whiche is moſte harde, he maye doo that whiche is moſte eaſie: The texte of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture importes that God may bring to paſſe that a rich man enter into the Kingdome of Heauen, whiche is moſte harde, then he maye bring to paſſe, that a Camell (or Cable) enter the eie of a Needle, whiche is more eaſie.</p>
               <p>The aunſweres of the Miniſters here before confuted, tend to theſe abſurdities and blaſphemies, that Ieſus Chriſt by his Omnipotencie could not enter throughe the doores be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhutte: that he coulde not iſſue out of the wombe of his Mother, through her body, without breaking: that he could nor bring to paſſe that a body viſible ſhould be inuiſible: that a body greate and groſſe coulde be in a place inequal to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: that he could by his Diuine power make penetration of the Dimenſions, and that he maye bring to paſſe by the ſame power Diuine, that one body be in two places (for it is al one reaſon of this laſte Article and the others) albeit ſuch things are declared in the Scripture not onely poſſible, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12892:45"/>
that the moſte parte haue bene done.</p>
               <p>And the Doctoures doe much maruell how the Miniſters dare denie this, ſéeing themſelues muſt neceſſarily confeſſe, (if the Doctrine of the Supper which they giue be true) that the bodye of Ieſus Chriſte is in diuers places, which they proue thus: The faithfull receiue in their ſoules Really, the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſte, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the holy Ghoſt, and not onely the bread and wine, or the effecte and vertue of the ſame Sacrament, as <hi>Calume</hi> ſaithe in his inſtitutions, <hi>lib. 4. cap. 17. ſect. 11.</hi> The Doctoures conclude thus: it is impoſſible that a perſon receiue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in himſelf, but that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Ieſus Chriſte muſt be in him: All the Faithfull which be at the Supper, receiue him in their ſoules, ſo that it muſte néedes be that the body of Ieſus Chriſte be in them, and by conſequence in diuers places, as euery where, where their Supper is made, and likewiſe in Heauen. They ſay further, that <hi>Caluine</hi> in his Inſtitutions, <hi>lib. 4. cap. 17. ſect. 24.</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines that in the Supper, the power of God is requiſite, to the ende the Fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte penetrate into vs, and that humaine nature can not comprehende that, but néedes muſt Gods power woorke in it: By which meane <hi>Caluine</hi> puttes, by the power of God, the Fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte in many places, as bothe in heauen, and vs, into whom he muſt penetrate by the power of God: And in the <hi>.10.</hi> number, he ſaithe, that the truthe ſignified and repreſented by ſignes, muſte be repreſented and exhibited in the very place where the ſignes be, which he proues by reaſon in many places, that is, that the ſignes muſt not be voide, no more than the pilloure was voide of the holy ſpirite: But euen as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſubſtance of the holy Ghoſte was conioyned and preſent with the pilloure, euen ſo that the Fleſhe and Bloud of our Lord, afore there was true Sacrament, muſt néedes be knitte and vnited with the ſignes: The places be againſt <hi>Heshuſius,</hi> and in his Booke of the Supper, <hi>1. Cor. Cap. 11.</hi> Whereunto howe ſo euer the Miniſters Aunſwere, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures deſire that the text of <hi>Caluine</hi> together with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:12892:46"/>
which he brings of the holy ſpirite, may be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered.</p>
               <p>They Obiect further, that the Miniſters in their Supper, attribute more to the humaine vertue, than to the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of God, yea they doe more than God coulde doe, as in that they vaunt to doe a thing by their Faith, which implies contradiction, ſaying in their Confeſſion of Faithe exhibited at <hi>Poiſsi,</hi> to the Biſhoppes which were in the congregation, that Faith makes things abſent, preſent at one inſtant, &amp; in one place, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the ſoules of the Faithfull when they make the ſupper: the ſame being as much as if they had ſaide, that faith makes things not preſent, preſent in one time &amp; place: ſo as, to euery Faithful man in the Supper comming woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, the Body of Ieſus Chriſte is there preſent in vertue of Faith: And yet is he not there preſent, as themſelues holde, ſaying, He is but in Heauen: wherein maye be ſéene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of contradiction that is preſente, and not preſente Really: neither can it ſerue to any purpoſe a little ſtippe or ſcape, whiche they ſaide to vs, that the body of Chriſte is on high corporally, but in the hearts of the Faithfull in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpiritually: For the ſpiritualitie can not take away the ſubſtance of the thing, and their Faith can not bring to paſſe that a body is not a body, and that a body hathe not his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, as they haue ſaide héere before.</p>
               <p>Therefore in what ſorte ſo euer, they confeſſe that the Faithfull in the Supper receiue the ſubſtance of the body of Ieſus Chriſte into their ſoules, they muſte neceſſarily and willingly confeſſe, that either their Faithe is more mightie than the vertue and infinite power of God, or elſe that God can bring to paſſe, that his body ſhall be locally in Heauen, and Sacramentally (Really notwithſtanding and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) in the Sacrament of the Aultare, in which pointe the Doctoures deſire to heare the Miniſters, and after to ſette downe their Aunſwere by writing: The Miniſters can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhewe by the woorde of God, that their Faithe can bring to paſſe, that in one inſtant and in one place, a thing ſhall be preſent and not preſent: And it is as muche to ſay, a thing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12892:46"/>
preſent and not preſent by Faithe, as to ſay the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte is in a Faithfull man, and is not: Neither néede there to be put any chanell of the power of the holy Spirite, to make the Fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte ſlide from Heauen hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the ſaide Fleſhe were not but in Heauen, and yet come to vs.</p>
               <p>And touching the poyntes which the Doctoures haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected that <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Theodore de Beza,</hi> were the firſt that ſaide that God could not bring to paſſe that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might be in two places, which newe Doctrine the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters would confirme by antiquitie, &amp; we not name it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes than blaſphemie. The Doctors ſay, that many times, they haue prayed the miniſters not to loſe time, &amp; to the end things might be better cleared, to ſay nothing that were not to purpoſe: which notwithſtanding, they alleage forthwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimonies of the fathers, to ſhew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a body by nature is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcript, &amp; naturally can not be in many places: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame authors ſpeake nothing, that God is able to do it: And yet <hi>S.

The Doctoures demaunde of the Miniſters, if any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Theodore de Beza,</hi> haue denyed this power of God, whome they maruell not if they ſo muche magnifie, ſéeing of them they haue taken all the places alleaged.</p>
               <p>For the Article that begins, where <hi>the Doctours pretende that the forme, &amp;c,</hi> the Doctoures ſay this forme is common as often as the power of God is debated vppon, neither
<pb facs="tcp:12892:47"/>
can ſhe proofe be better guided, than to folowe the woorde of the Aungell, that there is nothing impoſſible to God: From which, when any thing is exempted, there is alleaged the ſelfe ſame that the Miniſters inferre, that there is a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie of things, wherof folowes an implication of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: as did the auncient Heretikes againſt the Fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte, alleaging alwayes ſome impoſſibilitie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature: doing the like againſte the Article of Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Incarnation, as if there had bene contradiction that God was man, &amp; man was God: As ſhall be eaſie to a wicked mind, to forge alwayes ſome contradiction in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propreties of nature: for the Article be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, wher <hi>the Doctors alleage that God can change, &amp;c,</hi> The Doctoures ſay they haue not well conceiued their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: For they take for a thing abſurde, that a ſubſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting affected of his qualities, may by Gods power, haue ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes contrary to his qualities: As if God coulde not bring to paſſe by his omnipotencie, that the fire poſſeſſing his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat, in place to burne, do refreſhe and qualifie, which no man of ſounde iudgement, and a Chriſtian would not denie: For the Article, <hi>touching the limitation of the povver, &amp;c,</hi> the Doctoures ſay, it ſéemes by the Aunſwere of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that Gods power is limitted according to his will: which is as muche to ſay, as God can not but that which he willes, which is manifeſtly falſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the Hebrue alleaged, it ſéemes the Miniſters haue deſire to ſhewe their ſkill therein: For ſuche recitall is nothing to purpoſe, reſting principally vpon the woorde <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> which is as muche to ſay as a thing, but it meanes not that we oughte to vnderſtand it as a thing done: the ſenſe of the place is ſuche by the woorde, ſhall any thing be hid from me? And bicauſe harde things be hid, and things impoſſible alſo more hid, they haue therefore turned, is there any thing hard (or impoſſible) to me: which <hi>Pagninus</hi> and other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Hebrue tonge, ſhew well that the verbe <hi>Pala,</hi> ſignifieth to hide. The Doctoures had not made Aunſwere to this, but to make it knowne that they are not aſtonied at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12892:47"/>
one woorde of Hebrue.</p>
               <p>For the Article beginning, <hi>touching the daunger, &amp;c,</hi> the Doctours ſay they are but woordes ſuperfluous, and what ſo euer the Miniſters were able to produce, others mighte vſe againſte them. And where they ſay it is a reproche in that they are obiected to corrupte the ſcripture, the Doctors ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Miniſters can not deny, that they chaunge not the ſenſe, and gloſe the matter of the Supper, this is my body, this is my bloude: By which and ſuche like Authorities vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of obſcure reaſons, euery one may pretend to corrupte the other Scriptures, and alleage certaine impoſſibilities of nature, and contradictions.</p>
               <p>For the Article beginning, <hi>touching the opinion of the ſcripture, that the body, &amp;c,</hi> the Doctors ſay, that in time and place they will declare their Obiections, and make a more large diſcourſe of the Sacrament of the Altare.</p>
               <p>Touching the Obiection of the Doctoures, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary parte doe not grounde their affirmation (which is that God can not bring to paſſe that one body be in two places) vppon the expreſſe teſtimonie of the Scripture, or that they can deduce it thereof: the Miniſters haue alleaged for all their places, but that God can not lie, God can not deny him ſelfe. But the Doctoures ſay this conſequence is nothing woorthe: God can not lie: God then can not bring to paſſe that one body be in two places, which notwithſtanding it had behoued the Miniſters to haue made ſo, if the places brought in, had ſerued to the purpoſe, like as alſo when it is ſaide that God can not lie, as the Miniſters haue recited: to be able to lie, is not power but infirmitie. So that it behoued to ſay thus, according to the true ſenſe: God is not infirme or weake, as to be able to lie, than God cannot bring to paſſe that one body be in two places: which conſequence woulde be ridiculare.</p>
               <p>And where the Miniſters haue broughte in certaine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the Auncientes, to proue that there is diuerſitie betwéene the Creatures and the Creator, and that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by Nature is euery where, and the Creatures are not in
<pb facs="tcp:12892:48"/>
diuers places naturally: The Doctoures receiue with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the Authorities of the holy Fathers, but there was no néede of their trauaile to produce the ſaide places for the confirmation of a thing ſo manifeſt, and which was not in difficultie: But the Doctors are yet to vnderſtand one only place of the Scripture, or one onely Teſtimonie of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes, which ſayeth, that God coulde not bring to paſſe that one body were in diuers places: The Doctoures deſire the Miniſters to receiue with like reuerence the Auncients ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially touching the interpretation of the holy Scripture, whoſe Expoſition ſhall be the iudge betwéene them and the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Vppon a requeſt made to the Lorde of <hi>Neuers</hi> by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to aſſigne a day for Aunſwere particularely to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article and reproche heaped before by the Doctoures in their Obiections: The ſaide Lorde prouided that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhoulde take away with them at nighte, one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Obiections, to the ende to come readely prepared the next day by noone to Aunſwere them: whereunto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures agréed, who for their partes made like requeſt, for ſufferaunce, to Replie to the Miniſters Aunſweres, if they ſawe it were ſo good, with the which they will giue Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching this Article of Gods omnipotencie, to the ende to paſſe further, and examine the Reall veritie of the bodie of Chriſte in the Sacramente of the Altare, like as alſo the Miniſters for their partes doe agrée to yelde a full Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what ſo euer ſhall be deduced by them.</p>
               <p>The morowe folowing, being Wedenſday the ſeuentens of Iulie, the companie being aſſembled, the Lorde of <hi>Neuers</hi> conſidering that the day afore, the Doctoures had furniſhed all the time, ſo that the Miniſters had no oportunitie to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere preſently, thoughte there was no leſſe leiſure due to them to Aunſwere, and therefore with other neceſſary reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes, which woulde haue bene a long and weary ſeaſon, he ordained from thence foorthe the conference to paſſe by wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that the Miniſters ſhoulde bring againe the Copie that was giuen them to Aunſwere, and ſende it vnto him,

But if withoute iudgement, we vſe this ſentence, and interprete it according to our fond fanſie, we may faine al things of God, and ſay he hathe made them, bicauſe he coulde make them: wherin we muſt not beléeue, that bicauſe he might, and may do all things, that therefore he hath made that, which he hath not made: but rather to enquire if he haue made it: and ſo the concluſion folowes, that the power of God is his wil, and his not power likewiſe his not wil. It reſted then to the doctors to ſhewe that God would make a body, which in one inſtant ſhould be in diuers places, as to ſhew that he could do it: And it is a maruellous matter, that they impute againſte the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to derogate the almightineſſe of God, as to except fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, that which is contrary to his wil: ſéeing they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues confeſſe it and except the ſame things as ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them and the Doctors no other difference, than that they ſay, <hi>that God brings to paſſe that one body be in diuers places in one inſtante, bicauſe he can doe it, and the Miniſters affirme, that he doth it not, and can not doe it, bicauſe he vvill not,</hi> for that (according to <hi>Tertullian</hi>) the power of God is his will.</p>

And touching their reaſon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Sacramente, to enforce and proue their ſaying, the Miniſters aunſwere, that the Angelles neuer vnderſtood nor ſaide, that the body of Ieſus Chriſte was in Heauen and in the Sacramente, in one ſelf ſort &amp; maner, nor that he was in the Sacrament, otherwayes than ſacramentally.</p>
               <p>And where they pretend to proue in their reſolution, that the Angels may in one inſtant be in diuerſe places, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we vnderſtande their reaſons, they ſhalbe aunſwered.</p>
               <p>Their ſpeache deliuereth abſurditie, to ſaie, that a Bodye being diſpoiled of his Dimenſions, forbeares not for all that to be a Body: For if it happened that a ſubſtance Corporall were wholy diſpoiled of his dime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions, it ſhould be no more a Body, but a ſubſtance not Corporal, &amp; of like nature to the Aungelles and Sprites. And albeit God by his power may ſeparate the Dimenſions of a ſubſtance, withoute corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, yet it cannot be, but they muſte be ſeparated from a Bodye, without corrupting the ſame: bicauſe the Qualitie and Dimenſions be Accidentes of the Subſtance, but not of the Body, which cannot ſubſiſte without them, bicauſe they are of his proper Eſſence.</p>
               <p>And where the Doctours inferre after in their obiection, that the weight in a body is a thing eſſential: the Miniſters denie it, and by this reaſon, if it were of the Eſſence of the Bodye the Bodye failing, it muſte alſo ceaſe to be. And yet we ſée, that the Body of Ieſus Chriſt glorified (to the which the bodyes of all the Electe ſhalbe conformed after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) dothe not forbeare to be and ſubſiſte, albeit at
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12892:50"/>
this daye it be exempt from al weightineſſe.</p>
               <p>Touching theire moſte ſtrong and mighty Argumente, that if twoo Bodyes maye be together in one place, one body may alſo be in diuers places at one inſtant, the Miniſters, withoute graunting their Antecedente, ſaie, theire Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence (vnder correction) is not good, as the Argumente it ſelfe is moſte weake. Adding this further that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures, neither haue proued, nor euer can proue by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor any Authoritie of the Auncientes, no nor any ſufficiente Reaſon, that either the matter of theire An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedente, or the Conſequence they inferre vppon it, are true.</p>
               <p>Where the Doctoures, to proue that twoo bodyes may be together in one place, alleage ſcripture, that Chriſte entred the houſe where his diſciples were, the doores being ſhutte, the Miniſters aunſwere, that it is not written that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the doores ſhutte, but onely the doores being ſhutte, whiche the Aunciente Interpreter hath giuen well to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, expounding in one of the places of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> (where ſtandes mention of the matter afore recited) <hi>Cum Fores eſſent clauſae,</hi> When the doores were ſhutte came Ieſus &amp;c. Yet the Miniſters ſaie, they beleue and are aſſured of the cleare opinion of the Scripture, that the doores being ſhutte he came, and ſtoode in the middeſt of his Diſciples: But that it cannot be defined nor determined whiche waye he entred, whether throughe the Walles, or by the Gates of Woode: whiche <hi>S. Hilarie</hi> him ſelfe puttes in doubte in his place alleaged by the Doctours: what ſoeuer it be, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay, that in entring he made his way myraculouſly, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one body (whether it were the wood or the wal) made place to the body of Ieſus Chriſt entring: or that an opening was made to him by the Aungel, who opened &amp; ſhut the doores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in a moment, as hath bene ſaid before. But in what faſhion ſo euer it was done, two bodyes were neuer founde together in one ſelfe place.</p>
               <p>Touching that they alleage of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his Booke <hi>de Agone Chriſtiano,</hi> that Chriſte entred by the doores, wée
<pb facs="tcp:12892:51"/>
denie not but that he entred not by the doores, but onely that two bodyes haue bene euer together in one ſelfe place: that if Ieſus Chriſte entred by the doores, the doores at his entrie gaue him place, as is ſaide.</p>
               <p>Where the Doctours alleage touching the ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apoſtles, that it was a Viſion, it apperteines nothing to the preſent matter, nor alſo that they maruelled of the manner of his entry, whiche was myraculous, as hath bene alwayes confeſſed to them.</p>
               <p>And where they adde after in the opinion that the ancient Heretikes had of the Body of Ieſus Chriſte, that it was not true, and that he did things aboue nature: the Miniſters tell them, that thei ſomewhat ſuppoſe what occaſion and ground of their errour the auncient Fathers had preſented to them, if they had confeſſed that which the Doctours doo prefer and defende obſtinately of the Bodye of Ieſus Chriſte: that he doth things not onely aboue nature, but alſo againſt nature, and againſt the wil and ordinaunce of God. And there is no doubte, but ſuch an opinion was a greate proofe to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> and other Heretikes that haue denied the true Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Ieſus Chriſte, if by the examples of the Doctours it were confeſſed, that the Body of Ieſus Chriſte (againſt the truth, nature, and eſſence of a Body) may be at one time in diuerſe places, or in one place together with an other body.</p>
               <p>To that which they alleage of <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters aunſwere, that the Booke they haue alleaged is falſely attributed to him: for it handles a mention of <hi>Origen (82.</hi> Queſtion) and yet <hi>Origen</hi> was more than an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeeres after him.</p>
               <p>And touching the opinion of the Graue, mentioned in the place they haue produced, it is aunſwered, that the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt doth clearely expreſſe, that there was greate trembling of the earthe when he roſe againe, and that the Angel rolled away the ſtone that cloſed the Graue, with the whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt Biſhop of Rome, writing to the Biſhops of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> where he ſaithe, that Ieſus roſe, the ſtone that couered the Sepulchre being rolled awaye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:12892:51"/>Touching the place of <hi>S. Hilarie</hi> alleaged by the Doctors, there is one woorde whiche maye ſuffice for their aunſwere, and expreſſely ſpoken by the ſaide holy Doctour, that Ieſus Chriſte, to whom all things are open (as the Doctours haue expounded the ſaid ſentence) or (according to the expoſition of the Miniſters) who makes way through al, by his Diuine vertue entred the doores being ſhut, by which he giues ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to vnderſtand, that to enter into the houſe where his diſciples were, he made himſelf way &amp; opening, neither can we conclude otherwaies by that which he hath written, but that his entry was myraculous.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> vpon <hi>S Luke</hi> alleaged by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, there can be no more inferred than <hi>S. Hilary</hi> hath ſaid: neither can there be other concluſion either of the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that Ieſus entred into the Houſe by a Diuine and woonderful vertue.</p>
               <p>Where they alleage of <hi>S. Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> touching the Virgyn, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt came out of her wombe, &amp; yet her virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; integrity was no way corrupted or defiled, yea &amp; ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a Virgyn before &amp; after her deliuery, the Miniſters beleue it, confeſſe it, &amp; teache it, yeelding their reaſon by the ſcripture, bicauſe ſhée neuer knewe man.</p>
               <p>But if thereupon they wil inferre that in the birth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Nulla interceſſerit apertio vteri,</hi> the Miniſters ſay, that ſuch concluſion ſhould be againſt the expreſſe text of the ſcripture, &amp; alſo the opinion of <hi>S. Luke</hi> in ſuche behalfe, <hi>Omne maſculinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adaperiens vuluam &amp;c.</hi> beſides the authority of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ancient Authours approuing no leſſe, as <hi>Origen</hi> vpon <hi>S.

               <p>To the authority which they alleage of <hi>S Ierome,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for aunſwere retourne onely his owne ſaying, that when Ieſus came where his Diſciples were, the Creature obeied his Creatour.</p>
               <p>The allegation whiche the Doctoures drawe out of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi>

ſerues nothing to confirme their matter.</p>
               <p>Touching the Hereſie, whiche <hi>S.

The Miniſters aunſwere, it was not neceſſary, that <hi>Iouinian,</hi> to eſcape the errour of the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> ſhould cal to doubte the Virginitie of Mary: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ground of that ſtandes vpon this, that ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knowne of man.</p>
               <p>Touching the Concluſion whiche the Doctours woulde drawe of the ſaide Authorities, and accommodate them to their pourpoſe (that one bodye maye be in twoo places at one inſtante, or that twoo bodyes maye be together in one place) the Miniſters ſaie, that is altogether impertinente, and that thei cannot any wayes inferre it of the place which they haue alleged, nor others which they can gather, neither that it can be found in any good Authour. By meane wherof they conclude againſt the Doctours, that as their ground is nothing, ſo they goe about falſely to authorize their errour by the name &amp; titles of the Ancients, as not vnderſtanding &amp; taking rightly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phraſe to penetrate, which certaine authors haue vſed: which ſignifieth not a confuſion or medling of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bodies occupying one ſelf place, but only the yéelding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one makes to an other to giue him place as we ſée &amp; proue in experience, that the ayre giues place to a man that walkes, &amp; to byrdes that fly. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion the Miniſtes ſay, that, that which they propoſe &amp; mainteine for their aunſwere doth not derogate or diminiſh in any thing the greatneſſe, glory, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, but eſtabliſheth &amp; aduanceth it much more than ſuch prodigious abſurdities as the Doctors prefer, &amp; ſéeke to perſuade without any reaſon or meane probable: for thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that all that happened, both in Chriſtes entry into the houſe where his diſciples were, &amp; the going out of the ſame, as alſo the womb of his mother, &amp; the graue, was a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; Diuine vertue of God. But they denye for all that, that any thing happened which was impoſſible, &amp; conteined any contradiction. The matters which they alleage of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:12892:52"/>
&amp; <hi>Beza</hi> are things friuolous, and proponed rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and impugne, than to ſearch and cleare the truth.</p>
               <p>And where they ſaie, that all Antiquitie in one accorde hath vnderſtande by the terme <hi>Aphantos apanton,</hi> that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt made himſelf inuiſible to his diſciples remaining in their preſence, the Miniſters, to aunſwere them, alleage one authoritie of <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> vpon <hi>S. Luke,</hi> who preferring theſe woordes, ſaithe, he withdrewe himſelfe from them, and an other of <hi>Nicholas de Lyra,</hi> whoſe opinion vppon this place is, that it was done by the agilitie of his glorious body, which might ſodainely vaniſhe.</p>
               <p>Touching that which they alleage of the penetration of heauens, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted thither, the Miniſters anſwer, that it is likely they did diuide &amp; were open, as at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baptiſme of our Sauiour Chriſt, the piller diſcended vpon him, &amp; alſo when <hi>S. Stephen</hi> was ſtoned.</p>
               <p>Touching that they reprehend in the firſt anſwere of the Miniſters, that in the <hi>12.</hi> chap. of the Actes, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the opening of the priſon: the Miniſters referre them to reade the text of the ſaid place diligently, where thei find, that after he had paſſed the firſt &amp; ſecond watch, the laſt gate of the priſon which was of yron, opened of it ſelfe to the Angel and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> to make them place.</p>
               <p>Where the doctors reply vpon the Miniſters anſwere, to the argument of the Camel, inferred in their firſt anſwere: the Miniſters auouch the integritie of their ſaid anſwere, as to conteine nothing againſt Gods woorde: but ſay, that they are beguiled, as referring that to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Camel, which ought not to be vnderſtande but of the ſaluation &amp; conuerſion of Riche men only wherof was mention made before: for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt in ſaying that, that which is impoſſible to men, is poſſible to God, pretends no other thing, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to anſwer to the queſtion propoſed by his diſciples, which is, who might be ſaued: whereunto he anſwered, that, that truely was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to men, who of them ſelues are inclined to truſte in theire Riches, but it was poſſible to God, as to be able to drawe theire hartes from that vaine confidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:53"/>Touching the argumente which they would ground vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the preſence of Ieſus Chriſte in the Supper (which thei would inferre to be in diuerſe places) the Miniſters confeſſe the Antecedent, and denie the Conſequence. For they haue no doubte but by faithe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in the Supper to all the Faithful, by which wée muſt not inferre that he is there Locally, Diffinitiuely, or Corporally: which where they ſay, it is not imaginable, the Miniſters auowe it, as in regarde of ſuche as are not taught and lightened by the Sprite of God, and haue no other ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, than that which their natural facultie giues them. But to ſuch as being lighted by Gods grace, haue a true and liuely faith in their hartes, it is no more impoſſible to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto them Ieſus Chriſte crucified in the Supper, than it was to the <hi>Galatheans</hi> to repreſent and repoſe him vnto them as preſent and viſible in the preaching of <hi>S. Paule:</hi> and to thoſe likewiſe of whom <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> makes mention in his Sermon of the Supper, that in celebrating it, they embrace the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſte, ſucke his Bloud, and fixe their tongue within his woundes: all which things are done by liuely contemplation and apprehenſion of Faithe, which is no other thing than a ſubſiſtaunce of things hoped for, and a demonſtration of ſuche as are inuiſible, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> defines it.</p>
               <p>Touching the truth of the thing conioined with his ſignes and Sacramentes, the Miniſters confeſſe, that outwarde ſignes are neuer withoute their effecte on the behalfe of the Faithful, who cannot participate with the Bread and Wine diſtributed in the Supper, but foorthwith they participate with the Fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte crucified for their ſinnes, and with his Bloud ſhedde, to ratifie the newe Allyaunce which God hath made with his people. But if the Doctours would inferre thereupon a Corporal Preſence in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Miniſters would denie it, and that by this reaſon, that ſuch preſence was not required of the ancient Fathers: who notwithſtanding did not forbeare to eate one ſelfe ſame foode with al the faithful of this day, as (with the helpe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12892:53"/>
of God) ſhall be more amplie declared, when it pleaſeth the Lord of <hi>Neuers</hi> to commaund conference of that matter.</p>
               <p>Where the Doctours, reproching the Miniſters, ſay that they attribute to themſelues humaine power, more than to the power of God, as ſaying that by Faithe they make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, things that are abſent: ſeeing God (according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the miniſters) can not bring to paſſe that one body be in diuers places at one inſtant. The ſayd Miniſters Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that ſuche <hi>Antitheſis</hi> are fooliſh and not to purpoſe, and that there is farre greater likelihoode, that the Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume more of their power, and the other Biſhops of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe churche, than of the power of God: For God hath not created by his woorde, but heauen, earthe, and the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contained therein, and they in their creation attribute to themſelues the power to Create their Creator, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in their <hi>Breuiarie,</hi> where the Prieſt ſayth, <hi>qui creauit me, creatur mediante me.</hi> The Miniſters alſo do greatly maruell, that the Doctors cal the vertue of Faith, humaine power, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great and wonderful effectes of the ſame, reuealed to vs in ſo many Examples of the Scriptures, ſpecially in the eleuenth to the Hebrues, where <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaythe, that the holy ones by Faithe haue vanquiſhed kingdomes. &amp;c. All which things doe not ſurmount the vertue only, but alſo the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of humaine vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Doctors replie that foloweth this Article, containes but numbers of vnprofitable and ſuperfluous woordes, and but little or nothing of neceſſary matter: And that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue more particularely Aunſwered to euery pointe which they repeate, they ſende them eftſoones to the former aunſweres, with this requeſt, not to ſerue them hence fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde with one meſſe twice.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſacrament of the Altare, as they call it, the miniſters neither receiue nor approue in any ſort that their Maſſe which they pretend to be a ſacrament, is a ſacrament, and muche leſſe a ſacrifice, by the which remiſſion of ſinnes may be any way obtained: yea they ſay, that both the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and ſacrifice by them pretended, with all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending

               <p>The confuting of the ſeconde blaſphemie, dependes vpon the diſproofe of the firſt: for albeit, God, contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world, hath done many miracles (as hathe bene recited héere before) yet there is no mutabilitie or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in his Councell.</p>
               <p>Touching the third blaſphemie, that if God did any thing contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the worlde, there ſhoulde be contradiction in his will, and therfore he ſhould be a lier: The Doctoures Obiecte that it would folowe, that ſuche ſhould be the will of God, neuer to doe any thing againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world, and that he wold haue ſtayed, and declared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be his will, by his woorde: For otherwayes it coulde not haue bene knowne what was Gods will. And as the miniſters neither haue, nor can make appeare by Gods woorde, that ſuche is Gods wil, as not to do any thing againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world, ſo they muſt firſte teache and inſtructe that ſuche is Gods will afore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that if God made one body to be in two places (or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing) againſt the order of Nature eſtabliſhed in the world, he ſhould be a lier.</p>
               <p>Touching the fourth blaſphemie, that Gods power is his will, and that his impower is his vnwill: According to the ſenſe which the miniſters giue it (if God can not doe but what he will) to be an Hereſie of the Heretikes called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchians
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12892:55"/>
in the primitiue Church: againſt whom <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> writes in his Booke <hi>aduerſus praxeam,</hi> and ſince renued by one <hi>Petrus Abaillardus,</hi> and continued by one <hi>VVickleffe:</hi> they in déede meaſured Gods power according to his will, the ſame contrary to the expreſſe woord of God, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times declars many things to be poſſible to God, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he wil not doe, as appeareth in <hi>Sap. 2</hi> where it is recited that God could ſende many ſortes of afflictions to the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> to chaſtiſe them, but he would not doe it, hauing diſpoſed all things by meaſure, number, and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and that he might deſtroy ſuche as had offended him, but he would not, but vſed mercy to them: In the goſpel, our Lorde ſaide to <hi>S. Peter:</hi> Thinkeſt not thou that I can pray to my Father, and he will ſende me more than twelue legions of Aungels, and yet as he would not pray to him: ſo his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not ſend them, although he was able to haue done it in the perſone of his ſonne: Chriſte might haue let his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to haue taken away his life, but he would not: And the Father might haue ſaued him from corporall Deathe (ſaithe <hi>S. Paule</hi>) by his power, but neither the one nor other would doe it: which albeit the miniſters might ſay was foreordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet the Scripture holdes expreſſely that he might haue done it, notwithſtanding it was foreordained.</p>
               <p>And touching the authoritie of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Doctoures are glad they produce it, as making altogither for the truthe againſte their blaſphemies, and yet they haue omitted many of his woordes and ſentences to confute their erroure, as the text it ſelfe heere witneſſeth. <hi>Nihil Deo difficile, Quis hoc ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciat? &amp; in poſſibilia apud ſeculum, poſſibilia apud deum, q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By which texte may eaſily be ſéene according to <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that God can doe many things which he will not doe, as to make a man to flie, but dothe it not, he can deſtroy the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritikes, &amp; yet ſpares them, bicauſe he wil not do all he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do.</p>
               <p>And touching their concluſion of the ſaide place of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> (that the power of God is his will, &amp; his impower like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his vnwill) they wel declare their ſleight examination of the meaning of that place: for <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith it not of his owne ſentence (conſidering he ſhould conclude againſte that he had ſaide afore) but he inferres it againſt the Monarchian heretikes: who held, that what God might do, he would do, and it was done: By which reaſon <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte them, that what God had not done, muſte néedes be hard and impoſſible to him: ſo that according to thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, it was all one to be done, and might be done: and not to be done, as muche as to be impoſſible to God: And of that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> inferreth) would folowe, that the power, the will, and the déede of God, ſhould be all one, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a thing not to be done, and to be impoſſible to God to do it, ſhould alſo be all one: And euen ſo alſo would be al one, the power of God and his will, and his impower and his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will: which <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes for an abſurd thing procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the opinion of the ſaide <hi>Monarchian</hi> Heretikes, and not of his ſentence, which was altogither contrary: wherin as we ſée the miniſters conſent in opinion with the ſaid <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchian</hi> Heretikes, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> refutes, ſo the moſte euident proofe ſtandes in the fifthe blaſphemie. And for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion againſt the ſaid blaſphemies, the Doctoures declars, that God can doe much more than he wil doe, and more than
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12892:56"/>
he hath eſtabliſhed in the world: for otherwayes woulde fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe yet other blaſphemies, as this, that the power of God ſhould not be infinite, but limitted: An other, that for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, all things ſhould be done in the world, bicauſe God could not otherwayes doe, than entertaine the order eſtabliſhed in the world: which <hi>Caluine</hi> himſelfe deteſtes, ſaying: that God of his omnipotencie chaungeth and altereth the order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as it ſéemes good to him, and to thinke otherwayes, were to limite his power and prouidence.</p>
               <p>Where the miniſters ſay in their ſaide firſt Article, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the auncient Doctors of the churche denied the omnipotencie of God: it is a moſt manifeſt falſhoode &amp; great wrong: for they deny it not, but interprete the ſcripture which ſéemes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, and ſo giue to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how it ought to be taken: that much leſſe by the ſame ſcripture well vnderſtanded, there is any exception at al ſuffred againſt the almightineſſe of God, ſéeing that in the contrary, it is confirmed as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaithe in his fifth Booke <hi>de Ciuitate Dei. Cap. 10.</hi> Gods power (ſaithe he) is in nothing diminiſhed, when it is ſaide, he can not die, nor be deceiued: For he can not ſuche things, bicauſe if he coulde them, his power ſhoulde be leſſened: concluding that he can not doe things which are of infirmitie, bicauſe he is almightie.</p>
               <p>Vppon the ende of the firſt Article, the miniſters chalenge vs, as ſaying their difference is that we mainteine a body to be in many places, bicauſe God can do it: and that of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the miniſters holde that it is not in Gods power to do ſo, bicauſe he wil not: The doctors declare that for their part, they neuer concluded to be true, that a true body was in two places, bicauſe God could do it.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion was only to know if God could doe it, to come afterwardes by order to proue by Scripture, that he wold do it: they haue already heretofore recited the ſcripture of the ſupper and the Aſcenſion, adding withall the Doctrine of <hi>Caluine</hi> touching the ſaid ſupper, to ſhewe that Gods will is to bring to paſſe, that a body be in two places (as in déede it is) according to the expreſſe woorde of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:57"/>Beſides, we haue produced to the ſame end the ſcriptures of the doores being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>one, which be like déedes and of the ſelfe reaſon to one body in many places: Of the contrary, the miniſters to deny the will of God, and depraue holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which ſheweth that ſuche is Gods will, that a body be in diuers places) alleage not any thing more inſtantly, than the impoſſibilitie of God to doe it. But to the ende that al the world vnderſtande the difference betweene vs, we preſently declare, that there hathe bene no other difference touching this Article vntill now, but to knowe whether it be in Gods power to bring to paſſe that a body be in two places at one inſtant or not.</p>
               <p>And for the ſecond Article, the Doctors ſay, the Miniſters Aunſwere not to the matter: For the Obiection was not, if quantitie were accidente of a Mathematical body, <hi>aut de pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamento quantitatis,</hi> (as the philoſophers hold) but to know if it were of the eſſence and neceſſitie to the quantitie of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be circumſcript and encloſed in place. And touching <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> alleaged by the Miniſters, he ſpeakes expreſſely according to the propretie of the diuine nature and corporall nature, ſaying: that the Diuine nature is euery where, but not the corporall, as of his naturall propretie requiring a certaine place: wherof the Doctoures make no difficultie, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaide naturall propertie. But the Queſtion is, if aboue nature by Goddes omnipotencie, it may not be that a body be withoute place equall to his greatneſſe, the ſame being openly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed by <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> when he ſpeakes <hi>De clanſis lanuis,</hi> hauing no longer regarde to the nature of things, but to the power of God: And we coulde wiſhe, that the miniſters woulde alleage this Epiſtle of <hi>S.

               <p>Touching the third Article, the miniſters are abuſed: for according to the Philoſophers and natural reaſon of bodies,

               <p>Touching the places of Scripture which they alleage to proue that there are places aboue the Heauens, they doo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe and abuſe the ambiguitie of the name of a Place. For in al their ſpeache of the dimenſion of Bodyes (whiche thei ſay doth neceſſarily require a place equal to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) they muſt meane Corporall places, as the dimenſion of bodyes demaunde.</p>
               <p>And now when they ſpeake of places aboue Heauen, they muſt vnderſtand &amp; meane the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other than Corporal, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch places, or like to thoſe wherin our bodyes be heard, but places incomprehenſible and imaginable, where bodies and Sprites are indifferent, without diſtinction of certaine ſpaces and places Corporall, for their greatneſſe: in whiche places the Rule of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſters is falſe, by which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that one body cannot be in one place, if it conteine not roumth according to the greatneſſe of the body: for the reſte we ſaie, the manner of Heretikes is, to interprete the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſpiritually, when they ſhould take them according to the Letter: and of the contrary to expounde by the Letter, that which oughte to be vnderſtanded ſpiritually and by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: as the Miniſters expounde the houſe of God in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world Literally and Corporally, as to conteine ſpaces and Corporall habitations, diuerſe, and ſeparated one from an other, albeit it oughte to be vnderſtanded ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the diuerſitie of degrées of beatitude: neither can the Doctours here omitte one manifeſt contradiction of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in this Article, wherein they pretende that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Soules of the bleſſed, are lodged aboue al the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and yet they lodge the Bodye of Ieſus Chriſte within Heauen.</p>
               <p>And touching the Article condemned by the Facultie of
<pb facs="tcp:12892:58"/>
the Diuines of <hi>Paris,</hi> we anſwer, that it is an ordinarie vſe with the Miniſters to alleage Authorities, either corrupt or improper. For the Article ſaithe, that the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aſſembled the Facultie, condemned all ſuche as would mainteine twoo ſeuerall Heauens, the one for Aungelles, and the other for the ſoules of men, whiche apperteines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Article the Miniſters impoſe vpon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures, who neuer attribute the propertie of God to any creature, and haue ſaide many times before, that to be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere, and incircumſcript, was not naturall to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but onely to God. Wherein the Authoures alleaged by the Miniſters (as <hi>S.

               <p>In this fifth Article the Miniſters haue not rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the reaſon of the Doctours, who haue not allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that Aungelles are circumſcripte naturally as well as bodyes: by whiche they woulde inferre, that the circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of place ſimply depended not as of the only &amp; eſſential cauſe of the dimenſions of a body, as by al their ſaid reaſons, the Miniſters pretende: notwithſtanding the Doctours are not ignorant, that, to put difference betwene corporall and ſpiritual creatures, there is a cuſtome in the ſchole to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels <hi>ſunt diffinitiuè in loco,</hi> &amp; bodies <hi>circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcriptiuè.</hi>

                  <hi>Gratian de Conſecratione Diſtinct. 2. C.

               </p>
               <p>And albeit there were <hi>Oportet,</hi> yet <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> vſing his cuſtome, ſpeakes according to the propertie of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, oppoſing the Diuinitie to the Humanitie, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not the operation of Goddes Omnipotencie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when he doothe make mention, and that he ſpeakes of the Sacramente, he affirmes expreſſely the Bodye of Ieſus Chriſte to be in diuerſe places by the Almightineſſe of God, as wée hope to deduce aſwell of him, as other Auncientes, in our reſolution.</p>
               <p>The eighth Article conteines many Erroures againſte Philoſophie and Truthe: as firſt, in that they make no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwéene a body called Mathematicall (whiche is) hauing dimenſion of largeneſſe, length, and height, and a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Phyſical or natural, that is, compoſed of a forme ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and matter, by the vnitie of which, it is made a body na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſubſtantial. In the ſecond place, if the body ſhould be without quantitie, yet would it differ from our ſoules ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, which be no ſubſtance materiall, and conſequently it would differ alſo from Angels and Sprites.</p>
               <p>In the thirde place, for concluſion of this Article, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters declare plainly not to acknowledg any ſubſtantiall
<pb facs="tcp:12892:59"/>
Body. And where they ſaie, that if God could ſeparate the dimenſions of a ſubſtance, and not corrupte it, that that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould remaine ſpirituall, as the Angells, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed: for that ſubſtance ſhoulde not remaine immateriall, as our Soules and Angelles doo, which be not capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, and therefore ſhoulde be ſtill differente from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and our Soules.</p>
               <p>To the ninth Article, the Miniſters anſwere nothing to pourpoſe: for the Doctours holde not, that grauitie &amp; weight are eſſentialles in a body, but to encline downewarde is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the heauineſſe &amp; weight of a body: thei demaunded alſo in their obiection, if an Earthely body and weighty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in his ſubſtance and natural heauineſſe, coulde not by Goddes almightineſſe, be ſuſpended on highe, but that it muſt encline downwaede, notwithſtanding it were againſt his nature and inclination.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, touching the anſwere to many Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning twoo bodyes to be in one place, and the places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture and Anciente Authoures produced by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours (to proue that it was in Goddes power to make twoo bodyes to be in one onely place) and by the like reaſon, that it was alſo in the ſame power to bring to paſſe, that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (of the contrary) be in twoo places, we ſaie, for the firſte, that the Miniſters doo wrong to denie this Conſequence, twoo bodyes maie be in one place by Goddes power, then of the contrary, one bodye by the ſame power maye be in twoo places: for there is aſmuche repugnancie of Goddes order eſtabliſhed in the one as in the other, and no leſſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in nature grounded vpon one cauſe and reaſon, which is, in the lymitation and circumſcription of a bodye: to the whiche as it is naturall to be in place, ſo is it natural to him to be in place proportioned, and coreſpondent to his dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And if for the number of diuerſe places where one body were, it might be inferred, that it were no more a body (as implying contradiction) euen by the ſame reaſon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to one onely place, where were many bodyes, it coulde not be inferred that they were no more bodyes, than many
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12892:59"/>
bodyes were one, whiche woulde implie like contradiction to the firſte.</p>
               <p>And where the Miniſters denie the Antecedent, which is, that twoo bodyes maye be in one place, we haue produced to proue it, the text of the doores being ſhut, the byrth of the body of our Lord of the Virgyn, the comming out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sepulcher, the paſſage of a Camell through the creuis of a Néedle, &amp; the penetration of the heauens, which Ieſus made at his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and bicauſe they deny theſe doings conteined expreſſely in the holy ſcripture, interpreted by the ancient Chriſtians, &amp; depraue it at their pleaſure, the Doctoures auouch againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the textes of thoſe Scripture, as foloweth.</p>

               <p>And to declare that the common conſent of all the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes hathe bene, that Ieſus entred by the doores ſhutte, the Doctoures preferre foure fundations drawne cute of the Auncientes: In the firſte they all confeſſe expreſſely, that the myracle of the entring was made in the Bodye of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte. The ſeconde, that ſuche myracle was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the nature of the Bodye, by the vertue of God. The thirde is, that expreſſely the Auncientes iudge, that in that
<pb facs="tcp:12892:60"/>
did conſiſte the myracle, that the bodye paſſed throughe the doores ſhutte, and was ſo with an other body.</p>
               <p>And for the fourth fundation they adde, that in regarde of ſuche an entring, the Apoſtles taught, that the bodye of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was no true bodye, but a Sprite or Viſion, whiche the Miniſters paſſe lightely withoute aunſwere. But if it be ſo, that by Goddes power (as the Miniſters holde) there was made an opening either by the doores, or other parte of the houſe, to giue entring to the bodye of Ieſus Chriſte, then the myracle ſhoulde not conſiſte in the ſaide Bodye, but in the doores or other parte of the houſe whiche were opened, and yet there was nothing contrarie to the nature of the Bodye of our Lorde, for it reſiſtes not any Bodye what ſo euer it be to enter by an opening made by myracle or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>Be it that <hi>Iuſtine</hi> is not the Authour of the Queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the Gentiles: yet it cannot be denyed that they were not of ſome Aunciente Chriſtians of the Primitiue Churche: And the Doctoures haue attributed them to him, on whoſe name they be entituled: onely the ſaide <hi>Iuſtine</hi> in the place alleaged makes the myracle to haue paſſed in the Bodye of Ieſus Chriſte, whiche being groſſe and thicke, entred throughe the ſhutte doores, againſte the nature of a Bodye by the power of God: and therefore the Apoſtles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed it to be a Viſion by reaſon of an entry made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute opening, as Sprites are woonte to enter. Sée the Texte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.

He addes that the doores, and all other openings were cloſed and faſte

Herein we referre to the texte, which we deſire to be wel examined by the Miniſters. <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> in the place recited ſaith, that <hi>S.

                  <hi>S.

               <p>It is moſte true that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in thrée Bookes at the

leaſte vſeth expreſſe opinion that this bodye paſſed throughe the ſhut doores, and that as the ſame was wrought by Gods power aboue the nature of Bodyes, ſo the Heretikes for all that ought not to denie the true Body of Ieſus Chriſte: this he ſpeakes in his Booke <hi>de C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his firſt Booke in the Hereſie <hi>20.</hi> and in the ſecond Booke <hi>64.</hi> againſte the <hi>Origeniſtes,</hi> declares that it is but a ſpirituall bodye: meaning that he loſeth nothing of his corporall ſubſtance, but changeth and draweth to him newe qualities and ſpiritual perfections conuenient to Sprites, as to paſſe throughe the walles without opening, giuing exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the bodye of Ieſus Chriſte after his Reſurrection, who pearced and paſſed throughe the doores being ſhutte: And ſo iudgeth (with others) that the myracle was done in the body of Ieſus Chriſte, as pearcing the ſhutte doores, as a Sprite, albeit he was a true Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</hi> determines alſo (with others) that this myracle happened in the body of our Lorde, who by the ſame woonder marched aboue the waters, contrary to the nature of a body by the power of God, reprehending al ſuch as ſtoode in any ielous ſuſpition that Chriſtes body was not Naturall.</p>
               <p>By al theſe authorities, the foure fundations afore propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are true, and therefore it is too greate an impudencie to ſéeke to corrupt the intente and faithe of ſo many Aunciente and Learned Chriſtians, to introduce a confuſion of new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. For beſides the diuerſitie of <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> the Miniſters auouche twoo others, as firſte that the Angell opened the doore, as if Ieſus had not had the power to open it himſelfe, or had needed other opening. The other is, that he made his opening where he woulde: by which diuerſities the Miniſters giue open declaration, that they knowe not whereupon to reſte: And (whiche woorſe is) they coulde not alleage one onely Aunciente, as Authoure of their fiction, or that is contrary to all the other, ſince the Primitiue Church,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12892:61"/>
it ſerues them to nothing, to alleage that the iron doore in the Actes of the Apoſtles opened to <hi>S. Peter</hi> of himſelfe, for the Doctors did neuer denie it: only we ſaid that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpake not of the doore of the priſone: And if at the entrie of Ieſus Chriſte, the doores had bene ſo opened, the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt had as eaſily graunted it, as he ſaid they were ſhutte, and as <hi>S. Luke</hi> ſaid, that this doore of iron opened of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>There is no difficultie, that the firſte that doubted of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in this world, did not agrée of the place touching the doores with the other Chriſtians. And all be it they thoughte to ſerue and aide themſelues with it, in the mainteining of their heriſtes (as with all the other miracles hapned in the body of Chriſte aboue nature) yet the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents neuer denied this facte, nor the other like to it, for feare to giue occaſion of erroure to the Heretikes, but they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and diſtinguiſhed what was the nature of the ſaid body, and that which hapned to him by the omnipotencie of God: The Chriſtians for any heriſie, did neuer abandon truthe: albeit the Heritikes haue ſometimes abuſed it: But now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtes body paſſed thorowe the doores without ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is certaine that two bodies haue bene in one place, and that they may be ſo: by which we haue well proued our propoſition which without either ſcripture or auncient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, the Miniſters denie.</p>
               <p>Touching the birth of Ieſus Chriſte without breaking of the Virgine: we ſay that a great part of the Auncientes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the place of the doores, holde that this miracle alſo was done in the body of our Lord, and not in the body of the Virgine, ſauing in that ſhée remained in hir integritie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking or opening. And for their reaſon, the Auncients haue alleaged the ſcripture, <hi>Ecce virgo concipiet &amp; pariet,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel, <hi>porta haec clauſa erit</hi>
                  </hi> as alſo <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> recites in his Epiſtle <hi>.80.</hi> wherin is contained a councel which <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> did aſſiſt, determining againſte <hi>Iouinian</hi> and other heritikes, that virginitie and integritie remained in the mother of God in hir deliuerie, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> repeating the ſame in the place alleaged by the Doctoures in his firſt Booke againſt <hi>Iulian,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:62"/>
Chap. <hi>2.</hi> And where the miniſters ſay, that the virgin ſhould not haue loſte hir virginitie, though our Lord had iſſued out as other men doe, in this they are condemned of hereſie by the Auncients, who note <hi>Iouinian</hi> to derogate the virginitie, as holding opinion with the miniſters: to whom the Doctors make this queſtion, what miracle they would acknowledge in the birthe of our Lord as touching his body, and the virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his mother, if he came from hir as other men do from their mothers, as the Miniſters write. And touching that which they alleage of <hi>Tertullian, Origen, S. Ambroſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> the Doctors ſay that <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> held ſuche hereſie and many others, which were reproued afore <hi>Iouini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> &amp; of this they haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned with him &amp; his conſorts. But for the reſpecte of <hi>S. Ambroſe,</hi> it is apparant, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued the contrary, as wel by the Councel which he aſſiſted, as by that which he writes in his Booke <hi>de institutione Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis:</hi> wherin we haue to interprete his woordes, that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus vuluam aperuerit,</hi> not that it was by breaking, but by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte of generation and production of his true body out of the bellie of his mother by miracle and vertue ſupernaturall: in ſuche ſorte, that euen as his Conception was miraculous, ſo alſo was his birthe. And <hi>aperire vuluam</hi> is a phraſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpéeche in the Scripture, as to ſay and name the firſte borne, in what ſort he might haue bene borne. And touching <hi>S. Ierome</hi> he ſaithe nothing of the breaking, but only that the body came out bloudie as he was in the wombe of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; to be bloudy is not required breaking of the mother. For concluſion of this Article, we would willingly aſke the Miniſters, if they holde as an Article of Faithe the virginitie of the mother after hir deliuerie: and if they can proue it by expreſſe and inreprocheable woorde of God written, bicauſe <hi>Beza</hi> calles in doubte theſe two poyntes at his pleaſure, and the Religion pretended reformed, amongſte other Articles of Faith of their diuers confeſſions imprinted, recites ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Virginitie of the mother of God after hir deliuerie, and ſometimes it is omitted. And in ſome Confeſſions is brought in no more but that Ieſus was borne of the virgine

               <p>The Doctoures applie for the Reſurrection and iſſuing of Chriſtes bodye thorowe the ſtone of the Sepulchre, the moſte parte of the Authorities alleaged by them vppon the doores ſhut, as the abſolute reading of the ſaide Authorities (will make Faithe) togither with <hi>Gregorius Nazianzene</hi> in his tragedie of the Paſſion of our Lord, who ioynes (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Auncients) theſe thrée miracles hapned in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord aboue nature, the birth without breaking the virgine, the reſurrection thorowe the ſtone, and his entrie thorowe the doores ſhutte. We ſay alſo that <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> make conſcience to ioyne with the Miniſters that oure Lorde roſe not againe, the Sepulchre being cloſed and ſhut, yea they had rather fall into the friuolous abſurdities, and vaine Expoſitions héere afore alleaged, than diſcende into the opinion of the Miniſters, bicauſe there is more Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in the texte of the Goſpell, that Ieſus was riſen afore the ſtone was rolled away by the Aungell, as the moſt parte of the Aunciente Chriſtians doe conſent: which meane alſo giues occaſion to beléeue more eaſily the Reſurrection of our Sauioure, than if the ſtone had bene taken away before his Reſurrection, for ſo it mighte haue bene more eaſily ſayde, that the bodie was tranſported, and not raiſed or riſen: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doothe the Texte beare that the Aungell rolled away the ſtone afore the Reſurrection, or when Ieſus did riſe or rather after, as is greate likelihoode in Scripture, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all Antiquitie. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> is euill alleaged by the Miniſters, as concealing that is wrytten in his Epiſtle tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſhutte dores, as alſo producing euill the matter of the Reſurrection: for it is not ſayde, that our Lorde did riſe after the ſtone of the monumente was rolled awaye: But it is ſayde agaynſte the fantaſtike ſorte, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance putte on the Croſſe, and that which reſted in the Sepulchre, and likewyſe that whiche roſe agayne the thirde day, the ſtone of the Monumente being rolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, is the true Fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte: By whiche ſpeaches the Pope meanes not to ſaye that oure Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:12892:63"/>
did not riſe afore the ſtone was reuerſed, but only declares, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt riſen, was a true body, and not fantaſticall, whoſe Reſurrection appeared by the opening of the monument: And this is the common interpretation of the Auncient authors, touching the reuerſement of the ſtone. For ende of theſe Auncient teſtimonies, we maruel that the miniſters ſéeing them ſo manifeſt and as conuinced, not only that God can bring to paſſe that two bodies be in one place, but alſo that he hath done it: dare reprochefully depraue the vnderſtanding of the ſame, and yet they ſay that the reaſons taken of ſuche and ſo euidente teſtimonies, are impertinent, Like as, by like licence (common with the Heritikes) they feare not, without any texte of the ſcripture, nor any place of the Ancients, to enterprete two bodies penetrating to be no other thing than one body to giue place to an other: of which falſe and licentious interpretacion, euen the common vſe of ſpéeche amongſte the Philoſophers, dothe condemne them: Like as alſo their fine example touching ſuch as walke tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the aire which moues them, and the birdes when they flie, is farre to ſubtill: And where they vaunt in the ſayde Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that in denying two bodies to be able to be in one place by the omnipotencie of God, or one body in two places, they yet aduaunce and magnifie the power of God, the ſame is as true, as when in all other their erroures by whiche they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne Gods truthe, and blaſpheeme it, yet they bragge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to aduaunce Gods glory: ſeeming héereby that they haue néed to couer their filthineſſe and deformitie with ſome cloke of ſpéeche, the better to blinde the ſimple and ignorant.</p>
               <p>The miniſters haue alſo good reaſon, not to ſeeke to excuſe the interpretacions of <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as too friuolous, and yet they preferre their owne much more vaine before their Maiſters: by which may be ſéene the agréement betwéene the Maiſters and Diſciples, vſing all, the foundacion of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is to beleeue and preferre afore all others their particulare and priuate interpretacion and inſpiration: where the Miniſters ſay that the body of oure Lord was not inuiſible to the diſciples, of whome is ſpoken in <hi>S. Luke. 24.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:12892:63"/>
but only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauing a ſwift body, was ſodainly withdrawne, we Obiect that the ſodaine departing which <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>de Lyra</hi> ſpeakes of, makes not that the body was inuiſible, according to the Gréeke woorde <hi>aphantos,</hi> not ſignifying ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine departure, but incapacitie to be ſéene and knowne: and ſo the text of the Scripture is apparantly for the Doctoures, as alſo, that as often as bothe the auncient and preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines giue example that Chriſt made himſelfe inuiſible, they alleage ordinarily this place.</p>
               <p>The miniſters, who vaunte to reſt onely vppon the pure woord of God, for the expoſition of the ſcripture, bring forthe their dreames grounded vppon their owne perſuaſion, as hath béene ſéene touching the doores being ſhutte: vſing the like licence to expounde the texte of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> which maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines expreſſely that our Lorde pierced the Heauens: and they ſay that it is a likely truthe that the Heauens deuided and were open: And if they be aſked from whence they fetch this interpretacion, their Aunſwere is from Goddes woorde grounded of their inwarde inſpiration, by the which they accommodate the ſaying of <hi>S. Mathevve,</hi> that the Heauens were open when the Piller diſcended vppon oure Lorde, as thoughe all the Heauens were deuided, and that the ſpirite could not deſcend without the ſame were opened, being not aduiſed that the ſcripture in many places takes the Heauen for the aire. And where they alleage that <hi>S. Stephen</hi> ſawe the Heauens open when he was ſtoned, it were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to the miniſters to interprete ſuch viſions to be done in ſpirite, as there is great likelihoode. Otherwayes two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles muſt be confeſſed, the one in the Diuiſion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and the other, in that the ſight of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> pierced not only into the Heauens, but alſo euen aboue: where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters confeſſe the body of Ieſus Chriſte is vpon the righte hand of his Father, which <hi>S. Stephen</hi> ſaw: the ſame being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the order of God eſtabliſhed in the world, by which it is neceſſary that there be a certaine difference betwéene the eie ſéeing, and the thing which is ſéene: Neither is it leſſe harde, that ſuche a thing be done, than that two bodyes be
<pb facs="tcp:12892:64"/>
penetrate: We muſt not forgette that oftentimes the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the appearings and ſpirituall viſions, vſeth this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that the Heauens were open, and yet in ſuche caſes there was but ſpirituall viſion, and likewiſe, but ſpirituall appearing: And as the Miniſters ſéeke to take the rigoure of the woorde opening of the Heauens, euen ſo they muſt not note it ſtraunge, if we wreſt in like rigoure the penetration of the Heauens, ſpecially in the Article of the Aſcention, where is Queſtion of the body of Ieſus Chriſte, which had already pierced bodyes more impenetrable than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which pointe of penetration of the Heauen, we referre to be more amplie handled an other time, as nowe to auoide tediouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the eight and twentieth Article, where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters againſte expreſſe ſcripture, defend obſtinately, that God of his power can not bring to paſſe, that a Camell or Cable enter the eye of a néedle, we can not a little maruell bothe at their blindneſſe, ſéeming to ſée nothing in the midde day, and at their frowarde obſtinacie: By which, as we can not iudge, that they vnderſtand not wel their fault, but ſinne euen againſt their conſcience, oppugning the truthe by them well knowne, ſo it ſéemes God ſuffereth this to happen to them in this text and place of the ſcripture ſo manifeſt, to the ende that by this Article the world may vnderſtande howe farre more hardie they are to giue falſe vnderſtandings of ſcriptures more obſcure than this, yea in the matter of the Auncient Chriſtians which are againſt them.</p>
               <p>But to the ende the world vnderſtand their great wrong, to denie that our Lorde can bring to paſſe, that a Camel (or cable) paſſe thorowe the hole of a néedle, we obiecte, that it were impoſſible to God to ſaue a riche man, vſing this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken of the texts of the Goſpell, it is more impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or harde that God ſaue a riche man than to bring to paſſe that a Camel (or cable) paſſe thorow the hole of an Néedle: God can not bring to paſſe (of his omnipotencie (as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſay) that a Camell enter the hole of a néedle, then he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12892:64"/>
can not of his almightineſſe make that a riche man be ſaued and enter into the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is of the Scripture, the <hi>Minor</hi> is confeſſed by the Miniſters: and the conſequence is neceſſary, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all Philoſophie, he that can not doe the moſte ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt can not doe the moſte hardeſt.</p>
               <p>The Auncientes alſo haue expounded withoute gaine ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the preſent Scripture, as <hi>Origen</hi> in his Homilie vppon this place, ſaying: it is poſſible that a Camell enter the eie of a néedle, not for all that, that it be poſſible as in reſpecte of men, but to God, like as the manner by which ſuche things may be done, is knowne to God, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſte, and to him to whome it is reuealed: <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> likewiſe in his Booke <hi>de ſpiritu &amp; littera, Cap. 1.</hi> and <hi>5.</hi> writes in this ſorte to <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> it ſéemes to thée an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde thing, when I tell thée that a man may be withoute ſinne, albeit there is none ſuche founde except Ieſus Chriſte thoughte it to ſeeme abſurde to thée, that a thyng may be done, whereof no Example can be ſhewed, ſéeing (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue) thou doubteſt not at all that it was neuer done that a Camell entred the eye of a néedle, and yet it is ſaid that ſuche a thing is poſſible to God.</p>
               <p>By their Aunſwere to the nine and twentie Article, it may eaſily be knowne, that they beguile and abuſe their Diſiples, making them beléeue by faire woordes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that Really in the Supper they receiue the bodie of Ieſus Chriſte, euen he that iſſued out of the wombe of the virgine, and was putte vppon the Croſſe for the reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankinde.</p>
               <p>And they ſéeke to make to vnderſtande, that theſe which put not to the Sacrament (which they call of the Supper) wyth the Breade and Wine but ſome Spirituall effecte onely, (as redemption, iuſtice, ſanctification, eternall life, and other giftes and benefites which Ieſus Chriſte brings to hys choſen) diminiſh the excellencie &amp; dignitie of the ſame Sacrament, and that they be <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> yea and that ouer
<pb facs="tcp:12892:65"/>
and aboue ſuche ſpirituall effectes, it muſte be beléeued that the body of Ieſus Chriſte is truely receiued in the Supper, and yet they feede an other opinion in their braine.</p>
               <p>For when they are preſſed to Argue, not being able to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine that fantaſticall preſence confeſſed in their writings, they make themſelues <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and returne to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence of Ieſus Chriſte in the Supper, the ſame being as muche to ſay, that biſides the Breade and Wine, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome ſpirituall effecte, and not Really the body, as the Miniſters holde in the preſente Aunſwere, which as they make manifeſt by that they recite of the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paule:</hi> ſo by the ſame may be gathered what is their opinion touching the ſupper, which is, that the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is not Really, but onely by ſpirituall effecte in the heartes of the Faithfull. For the <hi>Galathians</hi> by the hearing of the preaching of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> did not receiue Really the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte crucified, but onely had an imagination of the Croſſe and Paſſion of Ieſus Chriſte, and receiued onely the frute of their Faithe: That is, by that meanes they were iuſtified and ſanctified before God.</p>
               <p>The Allegation alſo which the Miniſters make of <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> tendes to this ende, to ſhewe that in the Supper is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued onely certaine effectes ſpirituall, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Allegorically are ſignified by theſe woordes to embrace the Croſſe of Ieſus Chriſte, to ſucke his bloude. &amp;c. wherein they denie (albeit againſte the intente of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> in his Sermon of the Supper) the Reall preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>The Doctoures confeſſe that the Argumente which they haue made, tendes to the <hi>Caluiniſtes,</hi> and not to the <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> neither did they thinke that the miniſters woulde other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes iudge of this Sacrament, than <hi>Caluine, Beza</hi> and the other miniſters, who vaunte them ſelues to be miniſters of the churche of the <hi>Caluiniſtes,</hi> which they call reformed. But thoſe which exhibited to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops being at <hi>Poiſsi</hi> the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion touching this Sacrament, vſed an other maner of ſpéech.</p>
               <p>They without difficultie confeſſed Really the Bodye of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12892:65"/>
Ieſus Chriſt to be preſent in the Supper, which at this daie the Miniſters denie with the Doctoures conferentes. And as farre as the Doctoures can iudge, the Miniſters be come of <hi>Caluiniſtes, Allemaniſtes:</hi> which ſuche wil not wel diſgeſt, as mainteine the Doctrine of the Churche, whiche they call Reformed, ſéeing their principal ſuppoſts faile them at néed, as vnable to aunſwere one Argumente obiected by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, as affirming in their aunſwere to be ſo farre illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Holy Sprite, which makes them vnderſtande and knowe al things.</p>
               <p>Touching the Article folowing, they reueale openly their preſent opinion touching the preſence of Chriſtes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Sacramente, bicauſe they ſaie, that the faitheful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no more in the time of the Goſpel, than the Ancientes before the Lawe, and vnder the Lawe. And it is certaine the Ancients receiued not Really the body of Ieſus Chriſt, which was not then formed, ſo that we muſte conclude that vnder the Goſpell is not receiued Really the Body of Ieſus Chriſte in the Sacrament, which the Miniſters cal the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>31.</hi> Article, they aunſwere not as in déede they coulde neuer anſwere. And neceſſarily they muſt confeſſe, that in vertue of theire Faithe they doo that whiche im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies contradiction: for they mainteine a thing in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant &amp; one place to be preſent, and not preſent: neither doth their ſpirituall, or rather fantaſticall preſence any thing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (according to their Doctrine) the body cannot be preſent, but with his dimenſions, Locally, Diffinitiuely, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, otherwayes it were to take cleane away, or corrupte the body. And the manner to be there ſpiritually, cannot make that the body be not there: otherwayes they ſaye falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is preſent in the Supper, and abuſe the worlde: wherefore it is neceſſary, that if the body be there (yea ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually) if their Doctrine be true of the nature of a body, that the body of Ieſus Chriſte be Corporally, Diffinitiuely, and Locally in the Supper. Beſides, ſéeing he is abſent, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their confeſſion, it folowes, that he is not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb facs="tcp:12892:66"/>
And as to conclude, the Miniſters ſaie, he is there, and that he is not there: ſo for an abſolute ſolution, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the principall of the argument, they thinke to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, with obiecting to vs certaine woordes of briefe, which wee haue not yet ſeene: which wée thinke they haue found in certaine Breuiaries of Monkes, as that thei remember whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were in the Couent they vſed ſo to chaunt and ſay. But albeit ſuch things were found in the Breuiaries vſed in the Romiſh Church, yet ſuch manner of ſpeach might be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſenſe which the Auncients haue giuen, when they ſaid the Apoſtles <hi>Conficiunt Corpus Christi:</hi> Like as alſo the ſcripture ſaith, that they baptize, they forgiue ſinnes, &amp; ſaue thoſe whom thei conuert, which is vnderſtand, as Miniſters of God, who of his authority, and as Maiſter, baptiſeth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth ſinnes, and iuſtifieth the faithful perſons.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters maruel that the Doctors cal faith, humaine vertue, conſidering the great &amp; woonderfull effects it woorketh: the Doctours replie, that they haue no great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of woonder, ſéeing that all woorke, ſo long as it is in man, &amp; that it woorkes there with God, is reputed humaine: as alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture cals the Faith of man, the woorke of man. The Doctours delare to the Miniſters, that according to their cuſtome, reſting alwayes vpon ſmal things, they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not that which is the principal in the mater, not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (or faining not to vnderſtand) where lies the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of that which is handled: as they doo in their aunſwer vppon the Argument proponed by the Doctours, by which they obiect that the Miniſters by their faith (whether it may be called Diuine or Humaine) may doo more than God can: to whiche Obiection the Miniſters, without entring to the pointe, aunſwere with ſongs.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>32</hi> Article thei paſſe ouer very lightly many obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctors: wherin whether ther be ſuperfluity or repetition, or whether they be impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to the Reader: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, the doctors wil not forbeare once againe, to require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring foorth ſome place of ſcripture to ground that God cannot bring to paſſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12892:66"/>
that one body be in twoo places, ſéeing this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence is too fooliſh &amp; vaine, God cannot lye: he cannot then bring to paſſe, that a body be in twoo places, for ſo muſt thei ſubſume. Wel, God hath ſaid &amp; ordeined that one body cannot be in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then he cannot make y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it be ſo: but they ſhall neuer teach the truth of the aſſumption, or <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in all their anſweres they coulde not bring foorthe any of that opinion, excepte <hi>S.

               <p>Touching the laſte Article, wée are fully determined to ſhewe by the pure and expreſſe Woorde of God, interpreted by the common conſent of all Antiquitie, that our Lord hath inſtituted the Sacramente and Sacrifice of the Aultare.

               <p>And laſtely that the Supper mainteined by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is no Sacramente in any ſorte, but a prophanation of Holy things, conteining execrable Blaſphemies, which al the worlde ought to abhorre.</p>

               <p>And albeit the Miniſters handling the Omnipotencie of God according as they haue learned by the conſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes of the Scriptures, agrée alwayes that he is God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12892:67"/>
as being able (without exception) to doo what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he will, and that there is no power neither in Heauen nor Earthe, which may hinder, change, or delay in any ſort the effect and perfecte execution of his eternal and immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able councelles: yet his Omnipotencie ought not to be ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched without diſcretion or diſtinction to all things general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that men maye conceiue and imagine in their fonde fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but to thoſe onely whiche neither are nor can be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his iuſtice, bountie, &amp; wiſedome, nor by conſequence againſte his holy and eternall will, wiſedome and truthe, which is and ſhalbe for euer to doo al things wel and wiſely with number, weight, and meaſure without any iniquitie, diſorder, or contradiction in any thing he doothe.

And to proue it by degrées, and ſet a truth of their ſlaunders, they chaunge and alter almoſte al the ſpeaches of the Miniſters, either by additions or retractions, as knowing, that without that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, they were without meane both to grounde their ſaide reproches, and giue them any colour of likelyhoode: whiche ſhal nowe appeare by the deduction and particulare confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their pretended blaſphemies againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Firſte they accuſe vs as to haue ſaide, that Gods Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie oughte not to be meaſured, but by the onely things which are conformable to his will, and not to derogate his wiſedome, his truthe, his nature, or the order which he hath eſtabliſhed in the worlde. Wherein to verifie their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſlaunder, they choppe and hacke this ſentence, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the laſte parte of it onely, whiche they haue ſeparated from the reſt, and which the Miniſters had limit to the whole for a more expreſſe and cleare declaration howe Goddes Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe ought to be knowne, beleued, and woorſhipped of al the worlde: neither haue they vnderſtande the terme of order according to the ſenſe and meaning of the Miniſters, who ſignifie thereby the eſtate and diſpoſition whiche God
<pb facs="tcp:12892:68"/>
hath eſtabliſhed, conſerues, and enterteines in all things by his eternall prouidence and immoueable will, onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept that no confuſion happen in his workes, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diffinition of <hi>S.

Wherein, to procure a more exception to the Doctrine aforeſaide, they obiecte the myracles that God did aboue nature, inferring thereby that God doothe and maye doo againſte his Order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>To the whiche the Miniſters aunſwere, that albeit the myracles be done ouer and aboue the ordinary courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet they are not done contrary to the Order aforeſaid, bicauſe al things referred to the prouidence and ordinaunce of God, be well done and rightely diſpoſed, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theire reaſon and Order be many times vnknowne to men, according to the opinion of <hi>Salomon,</hi> God doothe all things in their time: to the whiche maye be appropriate a teſtimonie out of the Sentences of <hi>S.

               <p>Neither doothe it followe, that that whiche is newe in cuſtome, is contrary to reaſon &amp;c. whereof if the Doctours will knowe further, lette them reade the ſeconde Booke made by the ſaide Holy Perſonage of the Order, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what he writes of the myracles in the fifth and ſixth Chapter of the thirde Booke of the Trinitie. This aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere may ſuffiſe to confute the twoo other pretended blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies which folowe in the obiection of the Doctours.</p>
               <p>And touching the fourth wée aunſwere, that the will of God maye be conſidered in twoo ſortes, as the Diuines teache: which is, as it is declared to men by woordes, ſignes, and effectes, and according as it is retained and hidde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: the one is called, Wil knowne by ſignes, and the other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12892:68"/>
the Will of the good pleaſure of God. For the regarde of the firſte conſideration, the Miniſters confeſſe, (as heretofore they haue ſaid to the doctors) that God can doo many things which he wil not. But to the other we ſaie, his wil is equal with his power as alſo his power (in that regard) is equal to his wil: According to which conſideration ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded and interpreted the ſentence of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by vs, and euill applied by the Doctours to the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians,</hi> as beſte may iudge all ſuche as heedefully reade that place produced by vs, who to aunſwere an other reproche of the ſaide Doctoures, accuſing vs of wrong to the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, as to accepte ſome matter of the Omnipotencie of God, are here enforced to reiterate <hi>Theodorete</hi> in his thirde Dialogue, who writes as foloweth: Wée muſte not ſaie, without ſome determination, that all things are poſſible to God: for who ſo holdes ſuche abſolute opinion, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendes all things aſwell good as euill, whiche oughte not in any ſorte be attributed to God.</p>
               <p>By whiche maye appeare, that neither this good Authour, nor the others before alleaged by vs, woulde not ſubmitte all things indifferently to Goddes power. But doo excepte what ſo euer is contrary to his will and eſſence.</p>
               <p>To be ſhorte, to qualifie the difference betwéene the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who holde it impoſſible one body to be in diuerſe places at one inſtant, and the Doctours which affirme the contrary: there is but one meane, which is, that the Doctours, without entring into ſo long a circuit, and waſting of ſpeache in allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſo many ſuperfluous matters, doo proue ſummarily by one onely place of the Scripture, that God wil doo it.</p>
               <p>To knowe whether the Miniſters haue wel or euil allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> as to proue that a body cannot be withoute place and meaſures, and alſo whether they haue well or euill defended, that the Quantity is eſſential in a body, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental (as the Doctours holde) they laie themſelues vppon the vpright iudgement of the Readers of the Acts of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p>Touching that which foloweth in the writing of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
<pb facs="tcp:12892:69"/>
that there is no place aboue the Heauens, wherein Ieſus Chriſt is not comprehended &amp; conteined: that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Sprites are therein differently without any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and diſtaunce of place.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters ſaie, that touching all thoſe pointes, they rather beleue the Scripture &amp; expreſſe woorde of God (which they haue alleaged) than all the ſuttleties and Sophiſtries which the Doctoures or others are able to bring foorthe, of their vaine Philoſophy. Beſides the ſame is expreſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined and taught in one of the Articles of our faithe, in this phraſe, From thence ſhal he come to iudge both the quicke &amp; the deade. By whiche muſte be noted, that there is <hi>Vnde,</hi> which is an Aduerbe, ſignifying place.</p>
               <p>Touching the fourth and fifth Articles to know whether the Miniſters haue impoſed any vntruth vpon the Doctors, they ſend the Readers to the actes of the former conference, as alſo to learne in what ſenſe, and to what ende the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue alleaged the Ancients, which they may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue by the reading and diligent obſeruation of theire places and ſentences there inferred.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſixth Article, wherin the Doctours had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſſe their Canons to be falſe, than in deferring the authoritie of the ſame, to auowe the body of Ieſus Chriſt to be true, and being true, that it is neceſſary that it be in one certaine place: the Miniſters anſwere, that by the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> place (from whence is taken the ſaide Canon) it is eaſie to iudge that the terme <hi>Oportet</hi> is muche more conuenient there, than this woorde <hi>Potest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the eighth Article the Miniſters anſwere, that a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance without quantitie, neither is, or can be any waie a body, whileſt it is and remaines ſo and the reaſon is, bicauſe they are twoo diuers predicaments, that of the ſubſtance &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the quantitie, vnder the which one ſelfe thing for one ſelfe reſpecte cannot be in any ſorte comprehended.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Chriſte alleageth no other reaſon, to declare his body was not a ſprite, but that he had members and partes, which bicauſe of their meaſures, mighte be handled and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12892:69"/>
Wherupon it foloweth, that without that, a ſubſtance can not be a body. And touching the difference that ſhuld reſt according to the opinion of the Doctors, betwéene our ſoules and bodies, exempt from qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie (if the ſame were poſſible) we ſay, that albeit they were ſubſtaunces different bothe in number and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> yet they ſhuld be like touching <hi>genus,</hi> and that bothe the one and other ſhould be contained vnder the kinde of ſubſtance not corpored.</p>
               <p>The miniſters paſſe ouer the ninthe Article, as a matter but of repeticion of woordes, and ſufficiently aunſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.</p>
               <p>Touching the tenth Article, we ſay in the firſt place, that the conſequence whereof there is Queſtion, can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be defended by the Doctoures, than by the rule that ſaithe, of one abſurditie may be inferred all things: we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine biſides of the time which the Doctoures make vs loſe in the reading of ſo many matters already aunſwered, and which ſeeme ſo often repeated by them, for none other ende than to fill paper, and perſuade the world that they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For in the firſt place, the Euangeliſt ſaithe not (as the Doctoures pretend) that Chriſte entred not by the ſhutte doores, but only that he came the doores being ſhutte, ſo that he ſpeakes not there in any ſort of the manner of his entrie, nor how the doores were opened, nor yet of any other parte of the houſe by the which he entred. And as al the ſayings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctors cannot be founded neither on the ſcripture, nor any authoritie of the Auncients by them alleaged, who ſtand ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſte, than with them: So, for concluſion, they haue no other ground of their opinion, than their ſingulare conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and imaginations, wyth ſiniſter interpreting the wrytings of the Auncients, to whoſe Faith they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and aſſubiect the Church, to the ende that hauing laid this foundation, they may builde afterwardes thereupon, all their abſurdities and erroures which they meane to deduce. And where they preſuppoſed, that when Ieſus entred the doores ſhut, when he walked vpon the waters, and came out of his graue, thoſe miracles were done rather in his perſon,
<pb facs="tcp:12892:70"/>
than in other things: <hi>Iuſtine</hi> wrytes the contrary, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mutation happening in his body, nor in the body of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> he brought to paſſe by his diuine vertue, that the Sea againſte his nature, ſerued him as a way: As alſo <hi>S. Hillarie</hi> ſaith to the ſame reſpecte, that by his power he did all things paſſible, with whom <hi>S. Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> conſents, as attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting all that to a power Diuine, and confeſſing frankely that he was ignorant of the manner and faſhion thereof. By meane wherof the Miniſters maruell much of the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctors, to offer to determine a thing left indeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſcripture &amp; the Auncients, and touching the which (according to the wiſe opinion of <hi>S. Hillarie</hi>) bothe the ſenſe and the woorde do faile, and the truthe of the facte excéedes the capacitie of humaine reaſon. How then dare the Doctors ſay ſo impudently, that Chriſtes body paſſed thorowe the doores, that there was penetration of Dimenſions, and that two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were in one place, ſéeing that of all this, there is not one only ſillable either in the ſcripture, or witneſſed by the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes, who confeſſe (as is ſaide) that their vnderſtandinge and ſenſes were to weake to comprehend or declare the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuche a Miſterie.</p>
               <p>Touching the birthe of Ieſus Chriſte, the miniſters ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcripture, whoſe cleare opinion is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the virgin was bigge bellied, ſhée broughte foorthe and was deliuered, ſhée gaue ſucke, and that in the deliuery, <hi>aperta est vulua:</hi> And yet dothe none of all this derogate or preiudice the ſtate of hir Virginitie or integritie, the ſame conſiſting in thys one pointe, that ſhée neither knewe, nor was knowne of any man.</p>
               <p>Wée ſay moreouer, that in beléeuing this, we folowe the ſcripture, and by conſequence can not erre, nor be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, neither likewiſe any other that aſſubiecte their ſenſe to Gods woorde, as the Auncientes by vs alleaged, haue done in this.</p>
               <p>In the Article folowing, proponed by the Doctoures tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner of Chriſtes Reſurrection, it containes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12892:70"/>
but coniectures and reproches, with ſuperfluous and weary repeticions, which we haue already ſatiſfied at the full by our former Aunſweres.</p>
               <p>And what ſo euer folowes after in the writings of the Doctoures, are but wrongs and iniuries in place of reaſons and argumentes, the ſame being the laſte ſhifte of contenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wittes, who being deſtitute of reaſon, and not able to yelde to truthe, defende themſelues with clamoures and ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter impoſitions.</p>
               <p>The Doctoures had ſome reaſon in their interpretation of the woorde <hi>Aphantos,</hi> if there folowed <hi>autois,</hi> but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſte ſaithe <hi>apantoin,</hi> ſhewing clearely that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the ſaid place and vnderſtanding of <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> (in which the miniſters do ſettle) is better than the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctoures.</p>
               <p>Touching the opening of the Heauens, we Aunſwer that they coulde not faile, vſing the phraſe of the Scripture, who ſaithe clearely, that at the Baptiſme of Ieſus Chriſte, the Heauens were deuided, and open when <hi>S. Stephen</hi> was ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And as we take it for an imagination of man, to applie to the aire, the ſignification of the Heauen: So we thinke it ſhould be to diminiſhe the maieſtie of God, and Ieſus Chriſt raiſed aboue all the Heauens, to eſtabliſhe the throne of his Maieſtie ſo lowe as in the aire. Neither is there any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce or likelihoode in the ſaying of the Doctoures tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the being of two bodyes in one place, and the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Miniſters of the ſighte of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> which ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched euen to the Heauens, bicauſe the one is a miracle of Gods power in nature, and the other a wonder againſte na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and contrary to Gods will.</p>
               <p>In the Article folowing, the Doctoures doe falſly impoſe vppon vs an opinion, that it was a thing impoſſible to God, that a Camel paſſe thorow the eie of an néedle, ſéeing in our former Aunſweres, we neuer touched that pointe, but only that part of the ſentence, ſpeaking of rich men. But now to Anſwer the Obiection and fully reſolue it, we ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euen as
<pb facs="tcp:12892:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God may ſaue a riche man, by chaunging him, and purging his heart of all vaine truſt and preſumption, wherewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected, he is incapable to enter into the kingdome of heauen: euen ſo it is no leſſe eaſie for him to make a Camel paſſe by the creuiſe of a néedle, hauing circonſiſed and digged the greatneſſe of the ſame, with other things which mighte let him to paſſe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, that the Supper which is celebrated in the reformed Churche, is the true inſtitution and ordinance of the true Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>And after, that the end for the which it was inſtituted, is, to aſſure the Faithfull of the true participation which they haue in the fleſhe of Ieſus Chriſte crucified for their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the bloud ſhedde for remiſſion of their ſinnes, and laſtly for the confirmation of the newe aliance which God hath contracted with his people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ſay it is neceſſary that the breade and wine, remaine in their propre ſubſtance, yea after the Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that other wayes they could not be ſacraments of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Finally we ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnfaithfull preſenting themſelues to the ſupper, can not (by meane of their infidelitie) receiue other thing than the outward ſignes of bread and wine, and that to their iudgement and condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> On the other ſide, we propone to the Doctoures touching their Maſſe, that as it is, &amp; celebrated at this day in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe churche, it is nothing but an inuention and tradition of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That it is a corruption and prophanation aſwell of the holy ſupper of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as of the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That it is an abuſe of the ſacrificature of the Papiſtes prieſtes, and that in the newe Teſtament there is no other ſacrificature ordained to procure and obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, nor alſo to interceſſe either by prayers or merites to obtaine the fauor of God, than the onely ſacrificature of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:12892:71"/>We ſay moreouer, that the ſacrifice of the Romiſh prieſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is a blaſphemie and Sacrilege, and that there is none other Oblation than that which Ieſus Chriſte hathe once made in the Croſſe of his body: by which the ire of God might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeſed, his iuſtice ſatiſfied, ſinners reconciled to God, ſinne pardoned, and the bonde of eternall deathe cancelled and made nothing.</p>
               <p>We ſay, the ſeperation of the prieſt in the Maſſe from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> reſt of the people, is a defacing to the Communion of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and (by conſequence) damnable afore God.</p>
               <p>It is an intollerable Idolatrie to worſhip breade &amp; wine:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> whether it be in the Maſſe, or out of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>There reſt yet two pointes in the wrytings of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures, wherof we admoniſhe them: the one is, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found in the ſcripture, that faith was a humaine worke,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. Ephe. 2.</note> but that it is a woorke of God, and a gifte which he giues to his choſen: The other is, that we confeſſe not to be able to produce any Auncient author which hathe ſaide in plaine termes, that one body cannot be in one inſtant in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bicauſe the contrary ſéemes ſo abſurde and ſtraunge, and ſo contrary to reaſon and faith, which all faithful men ought to haue: that we thought ſuch opinion could neuer find place in the hart of any profeſſing to be a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>To ende this Aunſwere, we could with greater delite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat vppon the queſtions aforeſaide, than diſpute vppon the opening of the doores, the ſepulchre and the heauens: as, (to our gréefe) we haue done thoſe dayes paſſed: and that for two reaſons. The one, bicauſe the deciſion and reſolution of ſuch queſtions can not be drawne and gathered of the ſcripture. And the ſeconde, bicauſe it can not muche ſerue either to the aduauncement of the honoure and glory of God, or to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe and inſtruction of his Churche.</p>

                  <hi>The Replie of the Doctors to the vvriting of the Miniſters, ſent vnto them by</hi> the Duke of Neuers, the .25 of Julie 1566. about .8. of the clocke in the Euening.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here the miniſters complain of their wrong to be called blaſphemers, as making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues innocent with Ieſus Chriſte, <hi>S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> and <hi>Naboth,</hi> vppon whome ſuche crime was falſly impoſed: the Doctoures ſay, that in this, they folowe the good <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> who ſtoode alwayes vpon complaint of the great wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries which they ſaide they endured of the Catholikes: And yet the Hiſtories ſtande as witneſſes of their conformitie with Ieſus Chriſte, <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Naboth,</hi> and alſo howe néerely theſe miniſters reſemble thoſe holy examples. The Anabaptiſtes might haue ſaide no leſſe to them of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churche, when they call them Heretikes: And ſo muche alſo might haue ſayd and did ſay, <hi>Seruet,</hi> who for his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies was burned at <hi>Geneua,</hi> eſtéeming himſelfe happie to be iudged by <hi>Caluine,</hi> a blaſphemer for his Doctrine, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſentence and paine of death. Therfore we muſt not beléeue the Minyſters to be other than the blaſphemers, though they ſhake of that name no leſſe impudently than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other heretike. But it behoues to examine whether their Doctrine import blaſphemie or not: we ſay, there is no blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie more worthy of greater curſſe, than to denie the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe of God, which is no leſſe than to denie ſimplie that God is not, which deniall containes a Theme. For to take from God, that which is proper to him according to his nature, is as much to ſay, he is not God: according to <hi>S. Baſile</hi> in an Homelie of his intituled, God is not author of euil: He writes, that it is no leſſe blaſphemie to ſay God is Author of euill, than to ſay that God is not God, bicauſe that to take from God his bountie, which is naturall to him, is wholely
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12892:72"/>
to ſpoile him of his Diuinitie, wherein the like may be ſaide of his omnipotencie, which who ſo denieth or diminiſheth, denieth alſo his Diuinitie.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then is to knowe, if the miniſters will abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe the omnipotencie of God, not in propre termes (for they ſéeme to confeſſe it) but in affirming that his almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is meaſured according to his wil: ſo that he cannot doe but that he wil, with other ſuche like propoſitions contained in their former Anſweres: which whether we haue proued or not, to containe blaſphemies, we lay vs vpon euery ſound iudgement, which hath any way ſerched the holy ſcriptures, or the bookes of the Auncient Chriſtians: which as they may alſo be knowne by the friuolous Aunſwers of the miniſters to our laſte Obiections, ſo, for oure partes, we maruell not much, if they be deceiued in the nature of the almightineſſe, ſéeing they erre in the grounde, as not knowing wherein it conſiſts, and why God is called almightie: For they ſay, they haue learned of the Scripture that God is omnipotent, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can doe all that he will, and nothing can reſiſt him: the ſame being as a ſigne of the power of God, but (vnder correction,) it is not the matter wherein it conſiſtes, and therefore to knowe it, it muſt be conſidered according to his Obiect, that is, according to things poſſible to doe, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is nothing poſſible, which God can not do: All thing (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception) is eſtéemed poſſible, where is not founde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to be, and not to be: and that comes not by the fault of the power of God (who can doe al things) but by the repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of the thing that can not be: which the Miniſters in the beginning had perhappes put in ſome Aunſwer, were it not, that bicauſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certain interrogatories, they Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Gods almightineſſe muſt be meaſured according to his will, and thinking to ſaue this error, they are ſlipped into diuers others, which they can not ſhift of, without falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an infinite abſurditie, as not to confeſſe to haue failed: Wherin their offence is more, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they goe about to limite &amp; bound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of God, &amp; not ſuffer it to ſtretch to al things generally, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſprite of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may conceiue &amp; imagine, ſéeing
<pb facs="tcp:12892:73"/>
(of the contrary) it is not to be douted, that Gods power is great aboue the conceit and imaginations of mannes ſpirite, yea it is infinite and incomprehenſible, as <hi>S Paule</hi> ſaith, God can doe more, than we eiſher demaunde or vnderſtande. And where the miniſters ſay, that God can doe onely all things which are not contrary to his iuſtice, his wiſdome, his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and truth, and therfore he can not doe all things general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it hath bene already told them, that to be able to do things contrary to the iuſtice, bountie, wiſdome, and truthe of God, was not power but impower. And by that alſo as (<hi>S Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaithe) in a place alleaged by vs in our former Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he can not doe ſuche things, it is an argument of his almightineſſe, and no reſtraint of the ſame.</p>
               <p>And where the miniſters inferre, that bicauſe God cannot doe ſuch things, by conſequence, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not do any thing which is contrary to his wiſdome and eternall will, which is, and ſhalbe for euer to doe all things well and wiſely, with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, poiſe, and meaſure, yea without that there be or ſhall be any iniquitie and contradiction in all that he dothe: it may here be ſéene how the miniſters diſguiſe that which is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, concealing the matter of their former writing touching the order eſtabliſhed in the worlde, againſte the which they ſaid God could do nothing, with other matters of blaſphemie, which as we did argue, ſo they durſte not reuiue them in their laſt anſwere, as in reſpecte their conſcience vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and kindled a knowledge, that as ſuch affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s could not be ſuſtained: ſo they could not auoide them, but in denying to haue written them, and ſo accuſe vs of ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, as to haue altered &amp; chaunged their matters by additions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions: for our purgation wherin we ſend them to our laſt obiection, where, as the words are produced in the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſo the ſaid blaſphemies are drawn out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propre words of the firſt article of the miniſters. And we refer our ſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> collation of our ſaid laſt writing, with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters: only it is, as alſo moſt certainely it will be found, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we haue faithfully recited the propre woordes of the miniſters, which as they wold not aduow in themſelues, ſo it wil be knowne
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12892:73"/>
at the laſte, that til now they haue mainteined propoſitions of blaſphemie, &amp; that therin wée haue done them no wrong, as pardoning their perſons, and being content to ſpeake our ſimple aduiſe of their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters, to ſhewe their iuſte cauſe to accuſe vs of ſlaunder, ſay in the firſt place, that wée haue cut of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, whiche was ſuche, that the almightineſſe of God ought not to be meaſured but by the things which onely are conformable to his will, and doo not derogate his wiſedome, his truthe, his nature, nor the order whiche he hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the worlde: and that of this, the laſte parte onely is taken by the Doctors, who for their purgation ſay, that they haue alwaies conſidered what was put in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſi, which is, if God can bring to paſſe, that one body be in twoo places. And to examine the truth of this Queſtion, afore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to writing, they laid the whole with euery part of the Miniſters propoſition: and haue thus argued, that God can doo al things which are conformable to his wil, the ſame neing knowne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is nothing that derogates either his wiſedome, his truthe, his nature, or the order whiche he hath eſtabliſhed in the worlde: as the Miniſters holde, one bodye to be in twoo places, derogates not the wiſedome of God, ſéeing for all that, God cannot be but wiſe, it dothe not derogate his truth, for he hath neuer ſaid, that he coulde not doo it, neither yet his nature, for if he ſhoulde, he ſhoulde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to be God: th if there be any repugnancy, it ſhould be in this, that it would derogate the order which God hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, the ſame being the cauſe that they reſt not but vpon the laſt Article. And wée thinke ſure, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters woulde not ſay, that to be able to make a body to be in diuerſe places, were a thing repugnant either to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, truthe, or nature of God, ſauing in that they iudge it repugnes the order which God hath eſtabliſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde. Beſides, the Miniſters hauing laid the ſaid propoſition as a Rule to knowe what God can doo, when they woulde acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate this Rule to the matter in contention, they oughte afterwardes to ſay ſo, to what things repugne that whiche

the Doctours preferre that one Body in one inſtant maye be in diuerſe places: but they ſaye and write onely what thing, that is to ſaie, Order &amp;c. whiche Relatiue cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde but with his former Antecedent, by which may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, that the Miniſters incurre the crime of ſlaunder, which falſely they obiecte to vs.</p>
               <p>And where they ſay, wée take not the terme of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eſtabliſhed in the worlde, in the ſenſe they meane it, wée aunſwere, that wée haue conſtrued the terme according to the vnderſtanding whiche the Miniſters haue giuen of it, according to our iudgemente of their ſpeaches, and phraſes thereof.</p>
               <p>For when was queſtion to bring in any myracle done by Ieſus Chriſte contrary or aboue the nature of things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Miniſters had alwayes their recourſe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon order of nature, as when ſpeache was vttered of the doores ſhutte, the comming foorth of the Graue, the Virgyns wombe, and of one Body to be in diuerſe places, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters vſed no other reaſon to withſtande it, than that al this was contrary to the Order eſtabliſhed in the worlde tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the nature of the Bodye, which as it cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande but of the common order wée ſée in nature, ſo the Doctoures haue therefore broughte in againſte them, that God cannot doo a myracle contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the worlde, taking it as the Miniſters haue declared in their former anſweres, againſt the order of nature, as kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing (for our partes) that the Ancients obſerued not this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference aboue nature, or contrary to nature: which appeareth by <hi>Tertullian</hi> heretofore alleaged, where is ſaide, that God can bring to paſſe contrary to nature, that a man flée aſwell as a byrde. But wee wil not ſtay vppon rigour of woordes, but apply to the Miniſters with whom wée conferre: who cal a woorke againſt the order eſtabliſhed in the world, a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be in diuers places, bicauſe it impugnes the common diſpoſition and property of bodyes: by which reaſon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours holde, that al other myracles ought alſo to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the worlde, bicauſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12892:74"/>
they are againſt the common diſpoſition and property of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And folowing ſtil the vnderſtanding which the Miniſters now giue of the order eſtabliſhed in the world, for the eſtate and diſpoſition which God hath appointed, conſerues &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteines al things by his eternal prouidence and immouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wil: to guide al things directly, and prouide that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion happen in his woorkes. Here the Miniſters committe eftſoones a new blaſphemy againſt Gods Omnipotency: for he may wholy chaunge, alter, &amp; deſtroy ſuch order as he hath eſtabliſhed in the world (albeit he wil neuer doo it) and raiſe a new world more perfecte than this. And if it were ſo that he could doo nothing contrary to this order, his power were terminable and limited: for he coulde not doo but certaine ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes according to the order which he had eſtabliſhed in the worlde, which ſhould happen not by the repugnancy of the Creatures, but bicauſe God ſhoulde binde euen his owne handes: And ſo (contrary to the Scripture) his hande ſhould be ſhortened, and his power reſtrained and lymited: from which blaſphemy flowe infinite others, as ſhalbe well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by vs, vpon occaſion and due oportunitie.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſeconde and thirde Blaſphemies noted by the Doctours, the Miniſters ſay, they haue ſatiſfied in one woorde by a newe interpretation of the order of the world, whiche fals oute nothing to pourpoſe, to diſſolue the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced by the Doctours.</p>
               <p>And the Miniſters paſſe ouer the places of Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, which open the Blaſphemy, and diſſemble the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of the Doctrine, with <hi>Caluines</hi> opnion touching Gods prouidence in the order eſtabliſhed in the world: like as alſo they ſpare to anſwere our obiection that from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third Blaſphemy many others doo flowe, fearing leaſt in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them they heape not blaſphemy vpon blaſphemy, &amp; by that meane make their Doctrine hateful to al the world.</p>
               <p>To aunſwere the fourth Blaſphemy, the Miniſters vſe a diſtinction of the Will of God, whiche may be conſidered in twoo ſortes, the firſt is called, Wil knowne by ſignes, and
<pb facs="tcp:12892:75"/>
the other a will of his good pleaſure. According to the firſte they confeſſe, that God can doo more than he wil, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeconde, which is (as they ſay) equall with the power of God, and hid and vnknowne to men: which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if it ought to haue place, we ſay, that the fundation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they fixe the truth pretended of this propoſition, God cannot bring to paſſe, that one body be in diuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is wholy reuerſed: For they will haue Goddes power meaſured according to his wil: not according to the ſeconde, which is hid from men, ſo that it muſt néedes be according to the firſte, by which they confeſſe, that God can doo more than he wil. By whiche it foloweth, that their Rule which they haue giuen to meaſure the power of God, is falſe: for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured by his wil, ſéeing he can doo more than he will.</p>
               <p>The Doctours ſaye further, that the Miniſters ought not require them to proue, that God would that one body were in twoo places, to ſhewe that he could doo it: for the Doctours would obiecte to them, that, to teache that God can doo any thing, we muſte not proue that afore he woulde doo it: ſéeing that (according to their confeſſion) God can doo more than he wil.</p>
               <p>Wée ſay further, that ſéeing the wil of God appeares not to vs but by ſignes, woords, &amp; effectes, and that the order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed of God in the worlde, according to his prouidence, (which the Miniſters agrée withall) is hid to men, that the Miniſters cannot affirme, and ſhewe that God hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſuch an order in the world, that one body cannot be in diuers places: for it behoued them to teache and inſtructe of ſuch ordinaunce of God, and declaration of his will. Many times they haue bene required to preferre onely one place of Scripture, where ſuch wil of God is manifeſt, or where it is ſaide, that he cannot bring to paſſe, that one body be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe places.</p>
               <p>Touching the place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> wee leaue to euery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte iudgemente the vnderſtanding of the ſame. And as for <hi>Theodorete,</hi> we finde him euil alleaged by the Miniſters, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12892:75"/>
woorking more againſt them, than he aides them. For wher he writes that we muſte not ſay indeterminately, that God can doo al things, comprehending therein both good and euil: in this he makes no reſtraint of Goddes Almightineſſe, but (of the contrary) he amplyfieth it, bicauſe that not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doo euil things, is a vertue &amp; power, as hath bene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore amply recited.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters require vs to ſhewe that God would that one Bodye be in diuerſe places, wée aunſwere, that they are twoo different queſtions, if God can doo it, and if he would doo it.</p>
               <p>And ſéeing it maye be confeſſed of all Chriſtians (as in déede it ought to be) that the power is in God, it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to proue the Will by the woorde of the Supper, and the Aſcenſion which they of the Religion pretended refourmed, haue in cuſtome to depraue and wreſte by the impoſſibilitie which they faine to be in God, to put one body in twoo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The Doctors leaue alſo to the iudgement of the Readers, whether the miniſters haue alleaged <hi>S.

But by this wée proue, that when there is any thing that preſſeth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, it is then they ſette a good countenaunce, and make ſhewe to haue good righte. Beſides, the Doctoures maruell muche howe the Miniſters dare affirme that <hi>Iuſtine,</hi> and all the Auncientes haue not put the myracle of the doores in the body of Ieſus Chriſt, ſéeing <hi>Iuſtine</hi> makes this expreſſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, howe it is poſſible, that a body groſſe be not let to paſſe throughe the doores ſhutte: in the anſwere of which queſtion, they conclude it, that bicauſe that myracle was done in the nature of the Bodye of Ieſus Chriſte, the Apoſtles iudged it was not a true Body, but a Sprite. As if the Body had bene tranſnatured into a ſprite, which <hi>Iuſtine</hi> ſaith, did not happen, but that withoute any chaunge of nature, ſuche operation to paſſe throughe the doores ſhutte, was giuen to the Bodye of Ieſus Chriſts by the Omnipotencie of God: as alſo <hi>Iuſtine</hi> ſaithe, not that anye myracle was done in the Sea, when Ieſus walked thereuppon, but that by the Almightineſſe that was in him, he made it portable, without chaunge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Bodye, or of the Sea, notwithſtanding the myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was in his Bodye, whiche contrary to his nature did ſo walke.</p>
               <p>It is not inoughe to alleage <hi>S.

               <p>And yet notwithſtanding he paſſed by the operation of the Omnipotencie whiche wroughte in his Bodye piercing the cloſe and ſhutte places, <hi>Nihil (inquit) ceſſit ex ſolido Paric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> with other like ſpeache whiche he vſeth, by which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderſtand any other thing, than a penetration of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bodyes.</p>

               <p>Touching al which pointes, the Doctours referre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the reading of the Bookes, without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate againſt the Miniſters, who thinke alwayes to abuſe the ignorance of ſuche as beleue them, to denie or affirme what they thinke good. And as we gréeue and are weary to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the reaſons herebefore ſo familiarely and clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſo by the euaſions of the Miniſters ſo often repeted, we are enforced eftſoones to intrude that, which by common conſent of the Ancients, they oughte to beleue, touching the Articles.</p>
               <p>We much maruel of the manner of Anſweres of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who without regard to the matter obiected to them, ſay what they thinke good of the pointes proponed, and not anſwere to the Argumentes: as in the Article that toucheth the byrth of Ieſus Chriſte: in the deduction whereof, wée haue brought foorth many teſtimonies of the Auncients, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that our Lord came myraculouſly from the belly of his mother, as he was alſo conceiued. Wherin as the ſaid Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes affirme, that that Natiuitie was done withoute any breaking to the body of the Virgyn, ſo they condemned in Hereſie al ſuch as helde the contrary: whiche the Miniſters ſéeke yet to mainteine, and for al their aunſwere affirme it ſtaying (as they ſay) vppon the Scripture, and dare not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſay, that they reiect the iudgementes of the Aunciente and Primitiue Churche, to repoſe vpon theire owne ſenſe, which notwithſtanding appeares clearely inough in theire Anſwere vpon this Article, wherein they falſely apply the Scripture, as thoughe it conteined that in the Byrth of our Lorde, <hi>A perta fuerit vulua Virginis.</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12892:77"/>
vppon this matter.</p>
               <p>In the Article of the reſurrection, whether there be other matters than coniectures, the reading of the Obiection of the Doctors ſhall witneſſe, the ſame being to be ſéene of ſuche as deſire to know the truthe. And where, vppon the ende of the Article of the Reſurrection, the miniſters complaine that we lay wrongs and ſcoffes vppon them, we doubte not but they take in diſpleaſure, that their ſuttleties and maners of doing are diſcouered: which, if they were well knowne, the world woulde not be ſo ſimplie beguiled, as héeretofore they haue bene.</p>
               <p>The Reſolution pretended by the miniſters, as being not written <hi>aphantos autois,</hi> but <hi>apauton,</hi> is not pertinent. For be it in what ſort ſo euer, our Lord was inuiſible to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whether it was by ſodaine vaniſhing away or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, the which vaniſhing in a body preſent at the eie not troubled, can not be done but that the body is made inuiſible to them. And how ſo euer it be, the Gréeke text beares inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and vnſeene.</p>
               <p>Touching the Article for the opening of the heauens, the miniſters (according to their cuſtome) aunſwer not directly. For it is not ſaide that the Heauens were deuided or open, when he mounted thither, as in the baptiſme of Ieſus Chriſt and the viſion of <hi>S. Stephen:</hi> but the ſcripture ſaith expreſſely, that Chriſte pierced the heauens, and not that the heauens diſcloſed to him: Neither can the miniſters forbeare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche vs, in deprauing the vnderſtanding of our writings, the ſame being witneſſed in this preſent Aunſwere, wherin they faine to vnderſtand that in that text of the ſcripture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that Chriſt pierced the heauens, we would ſignifie the aire vnder the name of the heauens, which neuer entred into our thought: only we ſaid, that the ſcripture many times ſpeaking of the opening of the Heauens, by the Heauens, meanes the aire: which ought not to be applied to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that our Lorde pierced the heauens. By this manner of Aunſwere, the miniſters thinke to make forgotten the force of the reaſons of the Doctoures, whoſe ſpéeche was thus: if
<pb facs="tcp:12892:78"/>
when it is ſpoken in the Scripture, that the Heauens were open, we muſt wreſt the woordes with rigor, and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that truely the Heauens did deuide: we muſte in like ſorte, when the Scripture ſaithe that Ieſus pierced the Heauens, take this woorde pierced in his propre ſignification, and with rigoure, which impugnes directly the diuiſion or opening, as things contrary one to an other: To which reaſon it giues none other Aunſwere, than ordinarily to the other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſaide Doctors.</p>
               <p>Touching the difference which they put betwéene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> which ſtretched euen to the high heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the being of two bodies in one place, and that the one is a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of nature, and the other a wonder againſt nature and the will of God: They ſhould doe muche (as being good ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the councell and will of God) if they coulde teache the Doctoures, that God would the one, and coulde not will the other, and ſo there woulde be reaſon in their ſaying, as to ſhewe what difference they aſſigne betwéene bothe.</p>
               <p>The inconſtancie of the Miniſters is knowne in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Camell, which is, whether God can make him paſſe through the eie of a néedle: For in their firſt Aunſwer vpon our Obiection, they ſaide without any diſtinction, that it was a thing impoſſible to God to bring to paſſe, that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel (or cable) entred the hole of a Néedle.</p>
               <p>And in their ſeconde Aunſwere, they alleage, that Chriſt, ſaying what was impoſſible to men, is poſſible to God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendes no other thing than to Aunſwer to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by his Diſciples, who may be ſaued: whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that that was impoſſible to men: And that alſo that ſentence of Ieſus Chriſte ought not to be vnderſtanded but of the ſaluation and conuerſion of the riche men onely: The which ſpéeche excluſiue (when the miniſters affirme that our Lord, ſaying: what is impoſſible to men, is poſſible to God, ought not to be vnderſtand but of the ſaluation of rich men) ſhewes clearely inoughe that the Miniſters ment to ſay by their Aunſwer, that our Lord did not meane to comprehend (vnder this propoſition what is impoſſible to men, is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12892:78"/>
to God) the poſſibilitie that a Camell may paſſe thorowe the eie of a néedle: as if this propoſition were not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand vniuerſally, of which our Lorde inferres this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, it is poſſible to God to ſaue a rich man: yea, he ſpeakes vniuerſally by expreſſe woordes, <hi>omnia apud Deum poſſibilia ſunt:</hi> we deſire ſuch as ſhall read this preſent wryting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the eſcapes of the Miniſters, whoſe good cuſtome is to diſauowe and denie the errors which they maintaine, when by the truthe they are conuinced.</p>
               <p>Nowe the miniſters, giuing ouer the defence that God can not bring to paſſe that a Camell paſſe thorowe the eie of a Néedle, haue inuented a moſte friuolous interpretation, in confeſſing that God can do it, but the meane ſhuld be, in that God might cut of, and diminiſhe the greatneſſe of a Camell, and all other things that might let him to paſſe: But the text can not brooke ſuche a gloſe, ſéeing oure Lorde ſpeakes of a thing altogither impoſſible to men: which ſhoulde not be: For albeit it were impoſſible for a man to make and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Camell of ſo little thickeneſſe and greatneſſe, as he might paſſe thorowe the eie of a Néedle, yet if God produced ſuch one, or if he did proportion or faſhion ſo farre the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and thickneſſe of a Camell, and that a man helde him, he might make him paſſe.</p>
               <p>But there is no Queſtion to produce a Camel, or to make him great or little, but only to make him paſſe, which ſhould be no miracle in reſpecte of the paſſage, if he were ſo little, but onely in regarde of the production of ſuche a Beaſte, or chaunge of his quantitie. And in taking this name of <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> for a Cable (which <hi>Caluine</hi> findes the better) the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of this newe expoſition wil appeare the better: For a man may ſo much extenuate a cable, by drawing out his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherof he is made, that in the end he might make it paſſe thorow the creuiſe of a Néedle. Beſides, it might be eaſie for a man to make a Néedle, whoſe hole might be ſo large, that a cable (yea a Camell) might paſſe therein: But the ſcripture ſpeakes of things impoſſible to a man, and according as they be in their nature: Therefore as we muſte take the hole
<pb facs="tcp:12892:79"/>
of a néedle in his little and ſtraite quantitie, ſo muſt we take a Camell (or cable) in his naturall greatneſſe, neither were the Auncientes euer ſo ſuttle, as to inuent ſuche politike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, which can not be red without laughing.</p>
               <p>But they can not ſo cunningly eſcape with this fine expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the world ſéeth not clearely inough how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that Gods power can ſtretche ſo farre, as to make, that a Camell remaining in his crokedneſſe and thickeneſſe may paſſe thorowe the hole of a néedle, but only, when, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God he is brought in quantitie proportionable to the hole of the néedle: the ſame being againſt the expreſſe text of the ſcripture, and farre from the expoſition of the Aunciente interpreters. Notwithſtanding that, biſides the literal ſenſe, they conſter the Camell ſometimes Allegoricallie, which Allegoricall expoſition takes not away the truthe of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe, no more than the Actes of Ieſus Chriſt forbeare to be true, albeit the interpreters expounde them Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie, wherein the miniſters are abuſed, as thinking, bicauſe they haue redde ſome interpretation other than literall in <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> that the compariſon which oure Lorde vſeth in this behalfe, is alſo a Parable: which is falſe: For it is a true ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that our Lorde vſeth to declare his power to ſaue a rich man, as being a matter of more difficultie, than to make a Camell paſſe thorow the eie of a néedle.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Article, we tell them once againe, that of the deniall of the ſcope of Gods omnipotencie, doe folowe many other abſurdities, which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwayes terme than blaſphemies: as, that by Gods almightineſſe two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can not be in one ſelfe place: that God can not make a body without circumſcription of place: That Chriſt did not enter, nor could enter by the doores ſhutte: That he did not, nor coulde riſe againe, but that the ſtone of the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente was taken away: that he is not, nor could iſſue out of the virgines wombe without diſcloſing the body of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that he did not, nor coulde penetrate the heauens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opening of the ſame: That he did not, nor could make a body, (yea euen his owne) inuiſible: And that he could not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12892:79"/>
bring to paſſe that a Camel (or cable) kéeping his groſeneſſe, might paſſe thorow the hole of a Néedle: From theſe is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the deniall of his almightineſſe, a blaſphemie moſte exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, and very atheiſme: Theſe be the diſordered abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſuch are enforced to confeſſe that denye the Reall preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Aultare: which the Doctors pray may be well conſidered by the Readers of this preſent cautele.</p>
               <p>Where the miniſters in the laſt Article of their Anſwer, chalenge vs for calling Faith an humaine worke, ſeeing it is of God, that is not to be maruelled in them no more than a numbre of other truthes which ſéeme ſtraunge to them: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Doctrine is grounded vpon the foundation of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, amongſt the which, this is not leaſt in degrée, that man hath not a frée will, and that for a man to thinke well, to wil well, and to do well, dothe not worke with God, contrary to many places of the Scripture, which ſettes a man woorking with God, bothe for his Faithe and workes, and receiues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the ſame: which ſhall be more aptly handled in an other place without varying from the matter. We are very glad the Miniſters confeſſe that the Auncientes neuer ſaide that a body was in two places which is true, but the reaſon they giue, why they haue not ſaide it, is of the forge and inuention of the Miniſters: they might tel vs as muche out of the teſtimonie of ſcripture, wherin is no more founde than in the writings of the Auncients, wherof we haue ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times warned the ſaid miniſters, who chalenge to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all their Doctrine vpon Gods woorde.</p>
               <p>If the miniſters at the beginning had confeſſed the truthe of the omnipotencie, or that they would haue acknowledged that Chriſte might bring to paſſe that his body mighte be on high, and néere below in the Sacrament really and truely, if he would, we had no néede to handle the queſtions paſſed: which notwithſtanding contain no ſmall conſequence, as the miniſters eſtéeme, the ſame appearing by the wrytings of the Auncients who haue handled thoſe places with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and with them, haue aided themſelues againſte the
<pb facs="tcp:12892:80"/>
heretikes: But bicauſe the miniſters wil not agrée that God may bring to paſſe that one bodie be in diuers places at one inſtante. And that if they had begon to ſhewe his will to be ſuche, as to ordaine that the body of Ieſus Chriſte might be in heauen and in the ſacrament, they might haue ſayde (as is the opinion of theſe of their ſecte) that God would it not, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could it not: And albeit we had rather treate firſt of the omnipotencie than of the wil, ſo, ſéeing the firſt hath ben ſufficiently handled, we are nowe in minde to proue that Ieſus Chriſte woulde and did ordaine his body to be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, in the proofe wherof, we will enter into the firſt conference after we vnderſtande the fanſie of the Miniſters what they helde in their Churche touching this matter, to the ende we trauaile not in vaine, as iudging that they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe not the opinion of <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> for which cauſe we ſay they, muche abuſed the people, faining to teache ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtome and Direction of the Refourmed Churche, and yet in their Aunſweres, they declare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
               <p>Where they holde themſelues righte happie to endure ſuche reproches, as to be eſtéemed ſeducers by vs, Let them remember that all ſectes may ſay as much as they, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be righte or wrong, we ſhall make ſéene by the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their Doctrine.</p>

               <p>All the difficulties that <hi>Abraham</hi> made vppon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which God made to him, proceeded of certaine impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of nature which he ſaw in himſelfe &amp; in his wife: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſéemes that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration ſtretched no further, til God vſed his authoritie and ſaid to him, I am God almightie: ſince warning of God, <hi>Abraham</hi> forgate all regardes to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preties of his nature, and tooke holde of this buckler of faith, which is to knowe and fully perſuade himſelfe, that God is almightie, to whome nothing is hard or impoſſible: And after this, when there was queſtion to ſlea his onely ſonne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had greate apparance of contradiction in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the woord of God giuen to him (which was, that from the ſéede of that ſonne ſhould iſſue one that ſhould bliſſe all nations, and yet he muſt kill him afore he had any linage diſcending of his bodie) yet he did not conteſt, as oppoſing this contradiction of nature, and of the woord of God, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that which had bene ſaide and promiſed him, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: but he had recourſe to the pilloure of the Faithe of the Faithfull (as <hi>S.

               <p>Likewiſe the conſideration of creatures, and the order of nature which <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſaw before him, made him fal into infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie: but God ſhewed him his fault, when he denyed that he was able to nouriſh the people long with fleſh: ſéeing the nature of the deſerte did not beare it, warning him to raiſe vp his ſpirite to the almightineſſe againſt nature, and there to ſettle and aſſure his Faithe.</p>

obteines expreſſely the firſt place amongeſt the Articles of the Apoſtles Créede, as being the ſame, by the which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles of Faith and dooings of God aboue nature, are beleued and mainteined againſt all contradiction and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancie of nature, or reaſon that may be pretended or allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and without the which, neither Article of the Faithe, or any dooings of God ſurpaſſing nature, and conteined in the Scripture, can be defended againſt the malice and depraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humaine Sprite, which tendes alwayes to infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diſobedience to God, and is prompt and ſuttle, from his byrth, to depraue and reproche the woord and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the ſame, by meane whereof wée ſay, that ſo much the more euery good Chriſtian oughte to enforce himſelfe to hold &amp; preſerue this Article whole, without either ſuffering any exception, or to reſtraine it to our ſingle pleaſure or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, vnder colour of incertaine pretended repugnances of Creatures mouing in the Sprites of men, for want of direct vnderſtanding, &amp; comprehending the greatneſſe of God: for as the Scripture giues to vs alwayes this Omnipotency in generall, without any reſtrainte in regarde of creatures and dooings of God, ſo it teacheth vs, that creatures are vnder his obedience, as the Clay in the handes of the Potter to receiue ſuch chaunge and forme as he thinks beſt, without that they can ſay, why doo you this to me, or why chaunge you me? ſuch ſimilitude of ſpeach vſe the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Ierome,</hi> and <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>Wée ſay further, that ſo much leſſe ought it to be licenced to men to limit and bound the ſaid power according to the contradictions which they imagyn in their fanſies, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wiſedome, or eternall will of God: ſéeing the expreſſe ſentence of the Scripture is, that as God can doo more than wée vnderſtand, ſo he ſmiles at ſuch as wil meddle with his nature, wiſedome, &amp; eternal wil: as if they were his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, and knewe further of his iudgements and ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than his owne woord dooth pronounce: and in the ende, all ſprites created are conſtrained with <hi>S.

               <p>Wée ſay further, that by ſuche licence and meane to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Goddes power at our pleaſure, vnder colour of certaine impoſſibilities of nature, or repugnancy ſuppoſed by our owne iudgement in the nature, wiſedome, or will of God, euery one may ſtudy to faine the like in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, wherein ſuche things may be eaſily inuented or diſguiſed.</p>
               <p>And that it be ſo, if all the Hereſies be obſerued that haue withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it in euery time from the firſt Article of the Creede euen to the laſte, it will appeare, that they al haue kept this way and methode, to ſhake euery Article of the Faith, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to God, conſidering the impoſſibility of the facte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature, and certaine pretended inconueniences againſt nature, wiſedome, will, and glory of God. To this effecte alſo wée apply the twoo firſte Bookes of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whereof the one is of the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſte, and the other of the Reſurrection of his Fleſhe, againſte the <hi>Marcioniſtes:</hi> wherein the Chriſtian Reader ſhall reade like Argumentes of the ſaide <hi>Marcioniſtes,</hi> labouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the Incarnation of our Sauiour, and Reſurrection of his Fleſhe, from the Omnipotency of God.</p>
               <p>Nowe to conclude this pointe, wée ſpeake it to all good Chriſtians, that to the ende to adde nothing to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, whoſe ſpeache is alwayes of the power of God to his Creatures, withoute any lymitation, and to the ende to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the infinite power, wiſedome, and eternall will of our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12892:82"/>
Creatour and Redéemer: and alſo not to open the veſſell of the ſecretes of God to euery impudent, who of his owne folie will ſette Lawes to men, but to the power, wiſedome, and eternal wil of God.</p>
               <p>And laſtely to the ende not to bring into the worlde all Hereſies onely, but alſo an Atheiſme, who (according to his ſenſe and fanſie,) may and will oppoſe and gaineſay the infinite power of the true, liuing, and eternall God.</p>
               <p>Wée affirme eftſoones that it is neceſſary to beleue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and mainteine, that our God is the Almighty Lorde without ende, to whom as nothing is impoſſible, ſo euen the leaſt of his woorkes ſtanding daily afore our eies, cannot be comprehended. And in plaine ſpeache, he is no more a Chriſtian, nor a faithfull man, who reſtraines or drawes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any lymit the power of God: for thereby he reuerſeth the maintenaunce of the Faithe, which ought to be generall, as to the which no exception can be giuen.</p>
               <p>But as the Omnipotency ought to be kepte in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie and perfection, ſo our opinion is, that it is not inough to ſay, that God is almighty, and hath the vertue to doo any thing, as to inferre that it is done: for all that our Lorde can doo, he hath not yet done, nor neuer wil do, bicauſe his power is infinite. But the knowledge of this omnipotency ſerues to confeſſe &amp; magnifie the greatneſſe of our God, &amp; to maintein his woorkes incredible by nature which are comprehended in his woord, &amp; in our Faith: and alſo to confute all ſuche as woulde deny any of them as impoſſible to be done by any manner what ſo euer.</p>
               <p>And bicauſe <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> with their Miniſters, raiſe them ſelues againſt the power and greatneſſe of our Lorde, and openly deny him to be able to commit the body &amp; bloude of Ieſus Chriſt vnder the formes of Breade and Wine: and bicauſe alſo that in the Religion pretended reformed, (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the efficacy of the woorde, This is my Body, this is my Bloude) they teach not a more great reaſon, nor more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liare to al thoſe that are out of the way, than the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, to be able to make a body to be in twoo or many
<pb facs="tcp:12892:83"/>
places, that is to ſay, in the Sacrament, and in Heauen: wée obiecte with good righte to the Miniſters, that in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they derogate the firſte Article of Faithe, which is, of the Almightineſſe of God. And alſo we knowe that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente manner of the Chriſtians, diſputing againſte the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of Faith, was oftentimes to beginne to aſke, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that whereon they doubted were poſſible to God or not, or whether onely he woulde not doo it: in which ſorte and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others propone the pointes wherein they enter into contention againſte the Heretikes.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, afore we paſſe further into the matter of the holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we would (in preamble wiſe) fele of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, whether they iudged it to be in Goddes power to make a body occupy many places, or whether only he would not &amp;c. wherein wée are enforced to aduertiſe al Chriſtians of one manner of dealing common to al the Miniſters of the pretended reformed Religion, which is, when they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, if God can eſtabliſh the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or not: they aunſwere, that there is no queſtion of the power of God, but of his Will onely. And when wée produce matter which declares the will of God, then (of the contrary) they deny that his wil is ſuche, bicauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to him. Alleaging here, their contradictions according to the nature of the body.

               <p>Here is alſo to be noted that, wherin an <hi>Almaine</hi> called <hi>Heshuſius,</hi> reprocheth <hi>Caluin,</hi> that he &amp; his felowe Miniſters are goodly &amp; noble amplifiers of the power of God, but when it comes to the déede and puſhe (as the ſaying runnes) they neither giue or graunte him any more, than they thinke méete, to introduce their errours and fanſies, reſembling (as the ſaide <hi>Almaine</hi> compares them) a good Traitor, who moſt dooth cheriſhe and magnifie a man, when he is moſt ready to betray him, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did our Lorde: wherin wée are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſay of the Miniſters touching Goddes Almightineſſe,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12892:83"/>
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of the Heretikes, <hi>Credendo non credunt,</hi> which is, in beleuing the Omnipotencie, they beleue it not: for when they haue ſaide, that there muſte be no exception, they hold againe an other way, that it muſt not ſtretch to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing that mannes ſprite can conceiue, and ſo they will not apply it but to what they thinke good, couering themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with the nature, wiſedome, &amp; eternal wil of God, which are no leſſe vnknowne and incomprehenſible to them, than his Omnipotencie: in which reſpecte wee aduiſe euery one not to be abuſed with the ſpeach of <hi>Caluin</hi> nor his miniſters, but to conſider the woorkes which they deny to be in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God. Wée haue produced to them theſe foure queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Whether God may make a body to be in twoo places, and (of the contrary) twoo bodyes in one place: Whether he can lodge one body in one ſpace, leſſe than his greatneſſe, and whether he can make it inuiſible, which haue bene ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially culled and choſen, for that vpon them are founded the principal arguments of the pretended reformed Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the true preſence of the Bodye and Bloude of Ieſus Chriſt in the Holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Wée beleue ſimply (as al other things) that the foure que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are poſſible to God, and haue proued it by the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his power, both by the ſcriptures, who giue vnto him al vertue ouer creatures without any exception, and alſo by Examples and ſtraunge myracles don vpon bodyes againſt their natures, which are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> holdeth in his Booke of the Reſurrection, to the ende wée beleue that our God is more mighty than al Lawe and nature of al bodyes, whereunto he addes, that ſuch knowe God very euill, who thinke that he hath not in his power, things which thei can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehende in their fanſie. From whence it comes (as <hi>S. Cyril</hi> ſaith) that ſuch wicked ſprites reiecte and condemne al things as impoſſible, bicauſe they vnderſtand them not.</p>

               <p>Of the contrary, the moſt parte of the auncient Authours of the Primitiue Churche haue holden expreſſely, that it was in Goddes power to beſtowe a creature in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> opinion againſte the Heretike <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> that the ſoules of the Sainctes maye aſſiſte in many places, with the immaculate Lambe our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte. Yea there was queſtion, Whether the ſaide ſoules and ſprites of the Holy ones, did aſſiſte at any time the Churches, where their Graues and Monumentes were: the ſame reſembling with <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his Booke whiche he wrote of the care to be had of the Dead, Chapter <hi>16.</hi> wher he ſaithe, that by the power of theire nature, the ſoules can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be here belowe, and in Heauen, or in many places, but that the ſame may be done by the power of God, and he will not reſolue, whether they vnderſtande our affayres by ſuche aſſiſtaunce in many places, or by reuelation of the Aungels, or other meane of the power and grace of God.</p>
               <p>Morouer it is moſt certaine, that the Auncient Fathers of the Churche, in the matter of the Holy Sacramente, haue acknowledged &amp; mainteined that the Body of Ieſus Chriſte by Omnipotencie was in many places, as <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> vpon the tenth of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, and <hi>S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> in his ſeuententh Homilie vpon the ſame Epiſtle,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12892:84"/>
where they both almoſte in one phraſe and woordes, write, that albeit in many places there be many actions and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Body of Ieſus Chriſte, yet hauing regard to the thing which is offered, (that is, to the true Lambe and body of Ieſus Chriſte) that Sacrifice offered in many places, is but one, bicauſe it is but one ſelfe thing, the true Lambe and true body of Ieſus Chriſte, which is but one, and remaines whole in all places where he is offered.</p>
               <p>And they adde further, that the Oblation of the ſame in diuers places, is not an iteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſacrifice of the Croſſe, but in commendation of the ſame: ſo that in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, they acknowledge and diſtinguiſhe twoo pointes, the one, concerning the Realty of the thing that is offered, which they ſaie is the true Lambe, and true Body of Ieſus Chriſt, who as then remaining one and in his entyer, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in many places. And the other concernes the action of ſuche a thing by the Prieſte, whiche is no itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor like action, or oblation to that of the Croſſe, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in commemoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithſtanding of that which was made on the Croſſe. <hi>S.

Auguſtine</hi> vpon the <hi>33.</hi> Pſalme declares, that the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the ſupper, was in two places, that is, in his viſible place amongeſte his Apoſtles, and yet betweene his proper handes, in ſuche ſorte as he carried him ſelfe. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concluded vpon this, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> debates with him ſelfe howe it was poſſible, that a perſon ſhoulde beare his Body betwéene his handes: And after he hath examined it to be impoſſible to <hi>Dauid</hi> and al other creatures, he diſcends at laſt to the Diuine power which was in Ieſus Chriſte, by the whiche, to him alone amongeſt other men that myracle was poſſible.</p>

of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> is, to ſhewe that Ieſus by his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie carried himſelfe, which was impoſſible to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

               <p>To end this queſtion of one body in many places, we ſay that it is not only in the power of God, but alſo we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that it is ſo done in the Sacrament, to the ende God be not founde a lyer or a deceiuer in his woord, by which Ieſus affirmed to his Apoſtles that that whiche he gaue with his handes was his true Body deliuered for vs. Which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes in his Booke of the Reſurrection after he had diſputed againſt ſuche as denied it to be poſſible to God: wherin it ſéemes that they ſaide (as the Miniſters ſaid firſte) there was ſomething impoſſible to God by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whiche is, that he could not lye nor deceiue: of which they tooke occaſion to paſſe further, and diſpute that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was alſo impoſſible to him: like as alſo the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12892:85"/>
of the point that could not lie, haue labored to inferre, that to put one body in two places, was impoſſible to him, as well as to lie and deceiue: in the ende, <hi>Tertullian</hi> accordes with the <hi>Martianiſtes</hi> that he had rather confeſſe that God could not deceiue, and that he is only weake and impotent in deceit, to the ende that thereby it might be ſéene, that he hath not otherwayes taughte or ſpoken, nor otherwayes diſpoſed the facte, than is contained in his woorde. Then, if he can not (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes) deceiue and abuſe, we muſt beléeue the reſurrection, as his word beares it, and not otherwayes, to the ende there be no deceit in the ſayd woorde and in God: Euen ſo we ſay, and willingly confeſſe that God can not lie nor deceiue, in regarde wherof we muſt beléeue, that he hath ſo willed and ordained the truthe of the ſupper, as the woord pronounceth, and not otherwayes.

               <p>In the Article folowing, the Doctoures pretende that for one body at one inſtante to be in diuers places, is not a thing that derogates the truthe of God: we maintaine the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it would derogate bothe his truthe, bicauſe there ſhould be in him (as is ſayde) yea and no, and alſo his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for that in his woorkes there ſhoulde be diſorder and confuſion: and by conſequent, it woulde derogate his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, ſéeing that in his doings there would be imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And we ſay further, that it would not only be againſte the diſpoſition and ordinary courſe of nature (as the Doctors faine to thinke and vnderſtande) but alſo againſt the eternal and immoueable will of our God.</p>

               <p>Wée ſay further, that the Doctoures oughte not to finde it more ſtrange, that Ieſus Chriſt mounting into heauen with a body termined and limited, made himſelfe opening to enter therin, than whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he diſcendes betwene the hands of Prieſts, ſinging their maſſes: for then as <hi>S.

The Doctors ought to haue conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted themſelues with the anſwer which we made them vpon the ſimilitude &amp; parable of the Camel.

Theſe ſentences with many other like founde in the writings of this good Father and other Auncientes, teache vs clearely the manner howe to make our profite of the Faithe wée haue in the Omnipotencie of God, which is, in referring it to his Will, and iudging his Will by his Woorde, and not by falſe imaginations, whiche either our ſprites maye conceiue, or others woulde propone to vs: as Sathan did to Ieſus Chriſte, whom he wente aboute to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to throwe him ſelfe headlong, vnder a vaine truſte to be ſuccoured by the Omnipotency of God.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe the <hi>Monarchians,</hi> who vnder the colour and pretence of Gods almightineſſe, which thei gathered of other myracles, would proue &amp; eſtabliſh their Hereſies, and take away the perſonal diſtinction which is betwéene the Father and the Sonne: ſaying, that God being almighty, might by that reaſon make him ſelfe Father and Sonne altogether. There be alſo Anabaptiſtes in theſe later times, who vnder a vaine aſſurance they repoſe in Gods almightineſſe, which hope that he can nouriſh them as he did the byrdes, will not incline to trauel. Many other ſuch like or greater inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may happen to al thoſe, who hauing ſuch wandring &amp; diſperſed thoughts of the omnipotency of God, would not reſtraine nor refer them to his wil: which we ſee is alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Doctors, who ſeeking to meaſure Gods almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe rather by their imaginations, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his wil &amp; woord, are (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith) become vaine in their diſcourſe, &amp; their harts (forſaken of vnderſtanding) are fillrd with darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>And as in ſeeking to behold the maieſty of God without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> limits &amp; boundes which he hath appointed in his word, they are becom ouerwhelmed &amp; engulphed in his glory: ſo thei are alſo fallen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which thei touched in their own reſolution, that bicauſe they haue not taken Goddes Woorde for theire guide, nor followed the Pathes and footeſteppes of his Holy Spirite, they are ſwarued from Faythe, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:12892:93"/>
(contrary to the opinion of the Doctours) is not defaced nor reuerſed by the conſideration of creatures &amp; woorkes of God (which are as mirrours of his glory and Diuinitie) if not, that by the ſame wée might be turned from the promiſſes of God, by the which wée are aſſured of his wil, and his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, which doothe warrante and aſſure to vs the effectes and accompliſhmentes of this his Holy will: which maye be clearely ſeene and obſerued in thoſe that were ſent by <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to eſpie and knowe the Lande of the <hi>Chananites:</hi> twoo of the which (<hi>Ioſua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi>) could neuer be drawne from the truſte they had put in their God, bicauſe that turning their mindes from the conſideration of all ſuch thinges as mighte kindle doubte in them (as from the ſtrength and munition of Townes, the numbers, force, weapons, and experience of the Countrie men) they fixed their mindes vpon the onely remembraunce and contemplation of the promiſſes whiche God had made them: where, (of the contrary others forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſaide promiſſes, and conſidering nothing but what they ſawe afore their eies, fell, and made to fal all the people with them into this curſed and damnable infidelitie, for the which they were ſo graeeuouſly puniſhed in the Deſerte, and ſhut out of the entry and ioy promiſed by God to their Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours.</p>
               <p>And in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whoſe Faithe remained firme and ſtable, chiefly by the conſideration of the promiſe and will of God, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith, ſo that the conſideration of Goddes Omnipotencie comes after, to ſuſteine and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that which he had of the promiſſe.</p>
               <p>By theſe examples wée may ſée what daunger there is to departe and fall from (neuer ſo litle) the woorde of God, by which wee are guided to the knowledge of his Will, and by the knowledge of his Will wée are drawne to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and iudgemente wee oughte to haue of his Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
               <p>For wante whereof, the Doctoures are fallen into the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and madde fanſies proponed to vs in their laſte reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that the Body of Ieſus Chriſte at one inſtant may be

Neither doth that ſerue any thing to proue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme their error, which they alleage chiefly of <hi>S.

               <p>We maruel much that the Doctors draw backe thus, and will not enter but vnwillingly into the conference of their Maſſe, to defende it, as alſo of the ſupper celebrated in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, to impugne it. For, ſeeing they holde it as the principall grounde of their Religion, and propone it as a meane to ſaluation to all the world, therefore in reſpecte not to be found ſeducers or light to beléeue or teach a thing which is not certaine nor well aſſured, they ought to ſtand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally furniſhed with reaſons, bothe to proue and defend readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which they beleeue and teache, and alſo to conuince ſuche as would denie it.</p>

               <p>THe Doctoures in their Preface, and afore they propone their Queſtions, call the Supper which is celebrated in the reformed Churches, a banket prophane and polluted: wherin, without either ſhame or feare, they firſte blaſpheme Ieſus Chriſte, which hath inſtituted it, and is the Originall Author, and then condemne the Apoſtles of impietie which haue celebrate and taughte it, with all the Auncient Churche folowing and obſeruing (whileſt ſhée dwelte in pureneſſe) the forme and manner which the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles had taught &amp; left by their writings. But we would gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe our maiſters, to note particularely, wherein we may violate the inſtitution &amp; ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, and leaue his example and the Apoſtles, in the celebration of the ſupper. For when we goe about to celebrate it, we aſſemble firſt all the churche, as Chriſt did his Apoſtles and diſciples, where, after confeſſion of ſinnes made publikely, &amp; to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande in the name of all, we pronounce a Sermon to the people: wherin, according to the grace &amp; facultie which God hath giuen vs, we declare the cauſes, occaſions, purpoſe, vſe, points, and effects of the holy ſupper, the rather to raiſe vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearts of the people to conſider the incomprehenſible chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which the father hathe ſhewed to his Churche, ſeeing in hir fauor, and to ſaue hir, he ſpared not his propre ſonne, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to a cruel death, accompanied with a curſſe: to the ende that euery one reuoluing in his minde ſo great a grace &amp; mercy, might not onely be warmed &amp; kindled in Gods loue, but alſo, abhorring the vnthankfulneſſe, rebellions, faultes &amp; ſinnes which he hathe committed againſt his maieſtie, might with grudge and diſpleaſure againſt them, go thorow himſelf betweene the armes of his ſonne ſtretched vpon the croſſe, to the end to aboliſh them wholly and generally, and ſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faith &amp; penance to prepare himſelf worthily to come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, &amp; receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefits which are there adminiſtred: this ſermon being don, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſter directing his face to the people, recites w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a loud voice, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtitution &amp; ordinance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper,
<pb facs="tcp:12892:95"/>
with a bréefe and diſtincte declaration of the ſame, he then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth to all ſuche, as be not ſufficiently inſtructed and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſed, that that is no place to preſent themſelues to, and likewiſe to ſuche as be Excommunicate or attainted of any ſinnes and ſlaunderous crimes for the which they haue not ſatiſfied to the Church, to abſtain, as not to pollute the Lords table: After all which, he goeth to the table, where hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bread, he giues thankes to God, breakes and diſtributes it to the people that are aſſembled: and ſo after, preſentes the cuppe to all ſuche as communicate, the which being done, he yeldes thankes to God, and geues leaue to the people.</p>
               <p>And thus, folowing in all reſpectes the Example and rule giuen by Ieſus Chriſte, we can not imagine whereuppon the Doctoures can grounde their ſaying and ſentence of the ſupper, as to call it a feaſt prophane and polluted: nether can wee gather, what it is that they eyther coulde or wold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in all our action, vnleſſe peraduenture they woulde chalenge &amp; taxe vs bicauſe we haue no Albes, ſtoles, fannes, croſſes, holy water, banners, iackets, lightes, incenſe, belles, and ſinging in an vnknowne tongue, muſike, organes, holy linnen, altares and clarkes to anſwere <hi>&amp; cum ſpiritu tuo:</hi> or peraduenture becauſe wée haue no direct words to the bread and wine (which are without eares) as the inchanters haue, nor croſſe and ſignes, nor leuation of the breade and wine, to the ende to make them be worſhipped, and laſtly bicauſe wee vſe not ſuch like toyes, inuented by men, and drawne partly from the <hi>Iewiſhe,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Pagane</hi> order in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of which things we ſhould make great conſcience, as being but Idolatries and ſuperſtitions, by the which the pureneſſe and integritie of chriſtian religion is wholly ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and corrupte.</p>

               <head>An Anſwere to the questions proponed by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures touching the Supper.</head>
               <p>TO Aunſwere the firſt queſtion we ſay, that the ſacrament conſidered in his perfection, conſiſtes in three things:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12892:95"/>
whereof the one is the Elemente, which <hi>Ireneus</hi> calles an earthly thing: an other the thing ſignified, named by the ſame Author a celeſtiall thing: the third is the woord, by the which the earthly thing is deputed or aſſigned to ſignifie the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thing, and to aſſure ſuche of the exhibition of the ſame, as with faith preſent themſelues to receiue it.</p>
               <p>To Aunſwere the ſecond Queſtion, we ſay, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, contained in his word, and declared by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter according to his commaundement, is the woord neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary with the Element to conſtitute the Sacrament, and not only the ſecrete and baſe pronunciation of certaine woordes not vnderſtanded addreſſed to the Elementes, nor any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that lies hid in them.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer to the third Article, we ſay, that by the woord aforeſaide the ſignes are changed, not touching the nature, or in reſpecte of the ſubſtance, but only in regard of the vſe, and that only during the Action in the which they ſerue.</p>
               <p>Touching the .iiij. queſtion, we Anſwere, that the breade and wine which were common before the Action of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, be conſecrated in the ſupper, that is, deputed by the word aforeſaide and ordinance of God declared by the miniſter to a holy and ſacred vſe: which is to repreſent and exhibite the things ſignified by them.</p>
               <p>This Aunſwere to the fourth, ſatiſfieth alſo the fifth que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>To the ſixth queſtion, we Aunſwer, that in the ſupper, the faithfull doe not onley receiue the giftes and graces of Ieſus Chriſte (as his iuſtice, life, and other fruites of his ſacrifice,) but alſo they receiue and poſſeſſe euen himſelf, and are made one with him, no leſſe truely and ſtricktly then the members be conioyned to one head: we ſay further, that this coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the fountaine and meane, of all the benefites, which diſcende vnto vs by him through Goddes grace: But we ſay with all, that this receiuing oughte to be attributed in all and by all, to the free woorking of the holy Ghoſte: who makes vs fitte and capable to knowe our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, with all his vertues and propreties, and in knowing him, to put oure
<pb facs="tcp:12892:96"/>
truſte in him, and in reappoſing our truſte in him, to poſſeſſe and enioy him wholly.</p>
               <p>To Aunſwere the .vij. queſtion, we ſay, that we reiecte and reproue the terme of concomitance, togither with the thing it ſignifieth: as being the occaſion that the common people haue bene barde and ſecluded from one of the eſſential partes of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which is the participation of the cup: and we ſay, it is an attempt againſt the diuine maieſtie, to ſeeke to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate that which the ſonne of God hathe conioyned, &amp; denie to any of his membres y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath willed and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be common to all: Like as alſo the reaſon of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires it, the ſame being inſtituted for our ſpirituall nouriture, the which (as doth the corporal) conſiſts in eating and drinking. To the end therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be a certain correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie betwéene bothe, it muſt be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as we are filled with the crucified fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen ſo alſo we be licou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his bloud ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes: To be ſhort, ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper was principally inſtituted, to declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deathe of our Lord, &amp; that in his death, his bloude was deuided from his body: it is very conuenient the bread &amp; wine be there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, to repreſent both the one and other, &amp; more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to propound to vs the whole miſterie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To the .viij. Queſtion, we acknowledge no other cauſe or meane for remiſſion of ſinnes, than the grace of God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; faith, by the which the effect of gods grace, &amp; the frute of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, are applied vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Our Aunſwer to the .ix. queſtion is, that the faithful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Supper, come not to receiue there a newe Ieſus Chriſt: with whom they haue not bene conioyned before, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a new iuſtice, which hath not bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate to them: But we ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any man preſent him ſelf there, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out faith, by want wherof he was not vnited, incorpored, &amp; knit in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte to participate with his iuſtice, his life, &amp; other his gifts and bleſſings, in this caſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſupper is vnprofitable to him, as meat to a dead man: But, if liuing by the meanes aforeſaid (by gods grace, the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and faith) he preſent himſelf there in ſuch eſtate, that then gods graces
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12892:96"/>
are multiplied, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, and increaſed in him more &amp; more: as the Circumciſion brought not to <hi>Abraham</hi> a new iuſtice, but ſealed and ratified that which had bene communicate to him before by the promiſſe, the which being knowne to the faithfull, in what degrée of vertue ſo euer they be, ought not to miſtake the holy ſupper, nor in any ſorte abſtaine from it, when they haue the occaſion and meanes to aſſiſt it, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſo farre aduaunced in the knowledge and feare of God, and in the faithe of his promiſſes, but that they may further profite and encreaſe therin (in what eſtate ſo euer they be) by the meanes which God hath lefte and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for this effecte in his Churche: neither is it poſſible that a man, hauing a true faith, in his heart, do otherwayes, hauing the commoditie of it: Bicauſe, the nature of faithe, is not to comprehend only the promiſſes of God, but alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender and bring foorthe in the hearts of the Faithfull, a wil to obey him, with obſeruation of his commaundements and ordinances.</p>
               <p>To Aunſwere the firſt Articles proponed by the Doctors touching their Maſſe, we ſay they blaſpheme openly Ieſus Chriſte, as to authoriſe vnder his name, and by his example, ſuch an abhomination: and that alſo they make a ſcoffe of the church and the world, to preach and wryte ſuch impieties.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Article of the Maſſe, we Aunſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no other ſacrifice in the church, by which men are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, and which makes him mercifull and fauourable to them (in appeaſing his wrath) than only that which Ieſus Chriſte hathe once offred to his father vppon the croſſe: the vertue of the which being eternal, to ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifie all the beleeuing and obtaine remiſſion of their ſinnes for euer, there is no néede of any others, nor that that which he hath once offered, be euer repeated.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer to the third Article, we ſay, that ſuche as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Maſſe, and other ſacrificature, than that of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſeeke to eſtabliſh for remiſſion of ſinnes, an other Sacrifice than that which he himſelfe offered in his bodie of the Croſſe, are Antichriſtes, and deface (in ſo muche as in
<pb facs="tcp:12892:97"/>
them is) all the vertue and frute of the deathe and ſacrifice of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>To Aunſwere the fourthe, we alleage that which <hi>S. Paule</hi> wryteth, that where is remiſſion, there is no more Oblation for the ſinne: And if it be ſo, that by the death of Ieſus Chriſt, remiſſion hathe bene obtained for vs, it foloweth that there is no more Oblation for ſinne, neither in the Maſſe nor oute of the Maſſe: And if there be none for the liuing, there is leſſe for them that be dead.</p>
               <p>For Aunſwere to the fifthe, we maintaine that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is of the eſſence of the ſupper according to <hi>S. Paule</hi> in the firſt to the Corinthians. Chap. <hi>10.</hi> and <hi>.11.</hi> and as the Canon and other partes of the Maſſe importes.</p>
               <p>For Aunſwere to the ſixthe, we alleage thrée things: Firſt that the Maſſe of the Papiſts is no Sacrament, and then, that the bodie of Ieſus Chriſte is not there, and conclude thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there can not be worſhipped therein but the breade and wine, which reſt there: which being creatures can not be woorſhipped, but that ſuche as doe woorſhip them, are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trers.</p>
               <p>To Aunſwere the ſeuenth and laſt Article, we ſay contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Doctors, that there is nothing in the Maſſe, which either directly or indirectly, is not contrary to Gods woorde.</p>
               <p>And for Concluſion, we aduiſe and praie the Doctoures, not to excéede or forſake the limites of the matter proponed this day to diſpute vpon, as they haue done héeretofore, to the ende that theſe two pointes, which ſtande at this day in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwéene them, may be perfectly and wholly decided, to the contentment and edifying of ſuche as ſhal read the Actes of this conference.</p>

               <p>The conſideration whereof (as wée hope) will not onely confirme the Catholikes in the faith of the ſaide Article, but alſo (with Goddes aide) bring home againe many that are ſtrayed and ſeparated from the Catholike Churche, vpon the vnderſtanding of the deteſtable erroures and blaſphemies ſuccéeding with the contradiction to the Real preſence of the Body of our Lorde in the ſaide Sacramente: whiche might alſo ſerue the Miniſters for their conuerſion, if without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they woulde examine &amp; ſincerely iudge of the reaſons &amp; actes proponed touching the power of God: where, as reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Holy Sprite, in place to confeſſe their errours, they are turned into all ſortes of wrongs and iniuries againſte ſuche as of good will reuealed them, miſconſtruing our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as not to tende but to deface and roote them out: wherin as wée were neuer moued ſo muche as in thoughte, ſo of the
<pb facs="tcp:12892:98"/>
contrary, we deſired nothing more than the ſaluation of the Miniſters, togither with all ſuche as were fallen from the true Catholike Churche: whereof, what better witneſſe can we prefer, than that in our ordinarie preaching we perſuade the people to pray to God for them: only we ſéeke to roote vp the raigne and kingdome of Sathan, and to aboliſh all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and peruerſe Doctrine, rather by the preaching of Gods worde, than any other meane: And much do we maruel, that the Miniſters ſéeme ſo hotly netled againſt vs in their laſte Aunſweres, ſéeing it is without occaſion on our ſide, as only chalenging many of our propoſitions to containe matter of blaſphemy, which they might haue ſuffiſed either to denie, or diſproue, leauing the Readers to iudge, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out entring into ſo warme choler, ſeeing that as they make profeſſion of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and modeſtie, ſo though they were vrged in iniurie, yet they ſhuld not enforce reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. They ought to remember the goodly titles wherwith they honoure the Catholike doctrine, as with the name of ſuperſtition, idolatrie, impietie, abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and many other like, yea not ſparing the perſonnes, calling the Popes, Biſhops and Prieſtes, Antichriſtes, and miniſters of Sathan: Againſt which checkes we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, when occaſion moues, to proue by Gods woorde, that ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles are inconuenient no leſſe to the perſons, than to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preached by them: And ſo albeit, the miniſters &amp; their furie, deſerue a ſharpe replie, yet to qualifie their Waſpiſhe ſtomakes, we will forbeare to Aunſwere the iniuries that touche our perſons and eſtates, and leauing all to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Readers without paſſion, we will only proceede to the pointes that concernes the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>In the firſte place, the miniſters do great wrong to vs and oures, to reſemble vs with the <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> as imputing falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vs to drawe the Church into a certaine place as did the <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> who placed hir onely in <hi>Afrike:</hi> For it is moſte manifeſt, that we neither knowe nor confeſſe other Churche then the Catholike, who (as the name beares) hathe bene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſince the Apoſtles, and ſtretcheth thorow all the world, in what Region, Countrey, or place ſo euer the faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12892:98"/>
in Ieſus Chriſt, be: albeit we reuerence the Romiſh church, as, amongſt others, the firſt and principal, as <hi>Ireneus Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Auguſtine,</hi> with other Auncientes, gaue hir this honor, to confeſſe hir principally, and as mother of all the other Churches: And therfore with farre more iuſt reaſon, that obiection might be applied againſt the miniſters, who can not ſay that their Churche is Catholike, as hauing taken hir originall in our time, ſéene and knowne at <hi>Geneua,</hi> and founded vppon the priuate opinion of one man, without that, in any time before, it can be ſhewed that any ſuche opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hathe bene holden in any nation what ſo euer, which ſhal be handled in his order, when we diſcende to examine the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors maintained by the Miniſters againſt the Article, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the holy Catholike Churche.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, the Miniſters oughte not to haue alleaged the violence, crueltie, and furie of the <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> againſte the Catholikes: ſeeing ſuche example condemnes them and their like.</p>
               <p>But bicauſe it doth but kindle a memorie of the hurts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which <hi>Fraunce</hi> hathe ſuffred by the ſetting on of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and for feare to ſtirre vp eftſoones to newe wrongs, we will ſtay no longer vpon this ſpéeche, ſhewing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the Miniſters, that the <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> reproched the Catholikes to endure perſecution by them, and that to roote them vp, they ſolicited Emperoures and Magiſtrates, as the Miniſters doe euill applie to vs: who confeſſe to deſire firſte of all the Conuerſion of all Sectes, and if they will not come to amendment, that then by good and holy lawes, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to lay ſuche puniſhment vppon them, as God be not blaſphemed, nor the people tormented, according to the Doctrine of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in an Epiſtle ſent <hi>ad Vincentium contra Denatistas,</hi> where he Confeſſeth that the Catholikes perſecuted the <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> as, of the contrarie, the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes</hi> afflicted alſo the Catholikes: Onely their perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons differed, for the Catholykes dyd not execute but by the Magiſtrates, and that procéeded of Charitie, to roote vp the euil which hindered the publike peace and tranquillitie;
<pb facs="tcp:12892:99"/>
where, of the contrary the <hi>Donatiſtes</hi> perſecuted without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie of the Magiſtrate, and procéeded of malice, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing but ruine and ſubuerſion: <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> allowes the firſte to be good, and according to God, and the ſeconde he makes to be wicked, and of the inſpiration of Sathan: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he brings many examples of the ſcripture: we haue ſtand ſomewhat long vppon this pointe, the rather to purge the ſlaunder which the Miniſters haue laide vpon vs, as that in our preachings, wrytings, and conference, we haue not ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched but their deſtruction, and alwayes to perſecute them: conſtruing it as a matter of particulare hate againſte them, and not of charitie and zeale to the truthe, to conuert as wel the miniſters, as ſuche as are ſeduced and abuſed by them: wherein we call God to witneſſe, and proteſt all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with requeſt to the miniſters to beléeue vs, attending Goddes iudgement vppon it, who is the only ſearcher of the heartes and affections of men.</p>
               <p>Touching the Article, where the Miniſters ſay that God is almightie, bicauſe he can doe all that he will: if they would haue red the wrytings of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> (whoſe Doctrine they diſdaine) they ſhould wel know that this reaſon is nothing: bicauſe the Angelles and ſuche as are bleſſed, being alwayes conformed to the wil of God, may doe all that they will doe, and there is no creature that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hinder the effect of their wil, and yet they are not omnipotent: touching the ſaying of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> (taking it as the miniſters do) the reaſon of Gods almightineſſe is too weake and falſe.</p>
               <p>But to haue a true vnderſtanding of this ſentence, we muſte conſider, that there is difference betwéene the will of God actuall, and the power of the wil, for God may wil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which he will not, nor neuer would: and therfore, he can will more then he will not actually, wherein we ought rather to meaſure his omnipotencie, then according to his actuall will.</p>
               <p>In this ſorte muſt we interprete the texte of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> that Goddes omnipotencie ſtretcheth to all things, which he can will, and not according as he actually willeth: <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:12892:99"/>
alſo is recited by the miniſters, being deſtitute of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the ſcripture, albeit in their former Aunſwere they vaunt to haue taken that reaſon of the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>In the Article folowing, the miniſters charge vs falſly, to haue curtalled ſome woords of their laſt wryting, which ſhall not be found true: For our text beares theſe woords: it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted that aboue all conceite and imagination of mannes ſpirit, Gods power is great, infinite, and incomprehenſible: by which may be clearely ſéene, that we ſpeake vniuerſally of all conceite and imagination, withoute exception of any, whether it be of wiſdome or of follie: therefore it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out néede to expreſſe the woordes of the miniſters, ſéeing the Doctors ſpake generally: the which that which goeth before, dothe ſhewe, as the miniſters haue recited it, where it is ſaid that we reprehended them, in that they gaue ſome reſtraint and limitation of the omnipotencie of God: as not ſuffering it to ſtretch generally to all things that mannes wit mighte imagine or conceiue: where, in theſe woordes, generally, and all things, they declare that we woulde comprehende accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to humaine iudgement, euen the fooliſh fanſies and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which men may comprehend: And that we would not cutte of anything of the wryting of the miniſters, who perhappes were of opinion that we would not ſay that God can doe all that a fonde braine can imagine, as fearing that we would inferre againſt them, that God could doe any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: which ſhould not folowe: for albeit in the iudgement of men, certaine things are eſtéemed fonde, yet ſéeing they are poſſible in themſelues, they may be done of God, but wiſely, notwithſtanding the witte of man iudge the contrary: Like as in many iudgementes, man beguiles himſelfe, eſtéeming that for follie, which is wiſdome with God, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith. So that we ſay, that all things which are to be imagined by man, are to be done with God, without excepting any thing ſauing ſuche things as implie contradiction to be and not to be, which can not be done in reſpecte of repugnancie procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their parte, and not by faulte of the power of God: wherein we pray ſuche, to whome theſe conferences ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:12892:100"/>
come, to note that the miniſters are alwayes found ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, when they lay that crime vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, like as in the former wryting they ſtande as conuinced therein.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters will alſo be founde ſlaunderers in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle folowing, where they clippe our ſayings, and falſly lay vpon vs to haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do any thing againſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: in déede we ſayd, that to holde that God could do nothing againſt the order which he hath eſtabliſhed in the worlde, is to blaſpheme God: in which may be diſcerned the ſlaunder of the miniſters, who mangling the ſpeeche, haue taken away theſe woordes, eſtabliſhed in the world: where they inferre that it is a blaſphemie to ſay, that God may do a thing which is not well ordered, it is oute of doubte: but to doe any thing contrary to the order eſtabliſhed in the world, importes not any thing diſordered, but onely mutation and chaunge of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without any diſorder, which the Miniſters confeſſe in their Article folowing.</p>
               <p>We greatly abhorre the blaſphemies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the next Article, whereof the firſte is, that one body be in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a thing derogante to the truth of God, bicauſe in God there ſhoulde be yea and not: ſo that the Miniſters hold that God ſhould not be true, if he broughte to paſſe one body to be in diuers places, and yet they neither teache, nor can teache, that God hathe euer ſayde that one body coulde not be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places: it impugnes the wiſdome of God, bicauſe in his woorkes, there ſhoulde be diſorder and confuſion, wherein likewiſe they confeſſe that God ſhuld not be wiſe, if he made one bodie at one inſtante to be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>The thirde is, that ſuche thing reſiſtes the omnipotencie of God, ſéeing in ſuche acte, there ſhould be ſuche imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that muche leſſe (according to the opinion of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) that God in doing this, ſhoulde be omnipotent, but of the contrarie, he ſhould be imperfect and impuiſſant.</p>
               <p>The fourthe is, that if ſuche a thing were done, it ſhoulde be againſte the eternall and immoueable will of God, and therefore God ſhould be mutable: Oute of which blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is neceſſarily vomited a manifeſt <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> that God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12892:100"/>
ſhould not be God, if he made one body in one inſtant to be in diuers places: For God can not be but true, wiſe, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and immoueable: which blaſphemies we are content to coate and marke only, with admoniſhment how many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſpring of their Doctrine that denie the Reall preſence of the body of Ieſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament: and not to ſtay any more to confute them, as being too manifeſt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regarde with all, to the ſaying of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> that there be hereſies, whome to diſcouer, is to refute them.</p>
               <p>In the Article folowing, they reſiſte that with ſo many times they haue ſaide, that God coulde not bring to paſſe that one bodie be in two places at one inſtante, bicauſe it impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the order which he hathe eſtabliſhed in the worlde, as though God could doe no other wayes, than according to the order which he hath already eſtabliſhed: and in this preſent Article they confeſſe that God can chaunge and alter the ſaid order, out of which Confeſſion we draw this argument: God can chaunge and alter the order, which he hath eſtabliſhed in the world, and that withoute any preiudice to his truthe, his wiſdome, power, and immoueable will: then he can chaunge the order by the which he hathe eſtabliſhed (as the Miniſters ſéeme to holde) that one bodie ſhould not be but in one place, and to bring to paſſe (in the contrarie, the order being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) that one bodie ſhall be in diuers places, and yet in that, there is no derogation to his truthe, wiſdome, power and will: and by conſequent that God of his omnipotencie may bring to paſſe that one body be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>Touching the Article of the diſtinction of the willes of God, the miniſters mumble all togither, vnderſtanding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſaide diſtinction, no more than where they ſay, that a body to be in two places, is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſocietie of thoſe things which God hathe declared by his woorde, that he can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſte them.</p>
               <p>Firſt there is queſtion of gods omnipotencie, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that which he can, &amp; not to his eſſence, &amp; that which is in himſelf: as is to be all one, wiſe, &amp; good: which things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to the omnipotencie, but of the eſſence in him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:101"/>Secondly, what reaſon is there to conferre the being of one body in one place, or to know whether God can make it to be in two or more places: with the eſſence of God which is one, incomprehenſible. &amp;c. ſéeing that ſuch things being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, appertain to the eſſence of God: And to be able to make a body in many places belonges not proprely to him, nor is referred to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the miniſters ſay that God by his woorde hathe declared his will concerning that he was one, which ſerues nothing to the preſent matter: But pardoning them thoſe follies, how dare they compare with the eſſence of God, that which is in contention, of the being of one body in one or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places: ſéeing God hath neuer ſayd, that he could not do it, as he hath pronounced manifeſtly al the other perfections which appertaine to the diuine eſſence: by which may be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, that it ſuffiſeth the miniſters to fill the paper, withoute grounding their opinion vpon any ſubſtantiall reaſon.</p>
               <p>Séeing they take for reproche, when they haue any woord cutte of, notwithſtanding the ſenſe remaine whole, we mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell they feared not to receiue the like Obiections from vs: as in the Article where is mention made of the definition of a body, they conceale that which giues ſolution to their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie: we defined a body to be a kinde of quantitie conſtant of thrée dimenſions, length, largeneſſe, and depth, which defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition comprehendes all the eſſence of a body, which is of the predicament of quantitie: neither is there mention made of the circumſcription of place in any ſorte: the miniſters ſay, that by our definition, we limite the body, and therefore it is circumſcripte: but they haue left out this litle woorde, place, maliciouſlie, as is to be ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>For the queſtion is not whether a body be limitted or not, ſéeing no man ſaithe it is infinite: But the Queſtion lies, whether it be circumſcript of place eſſentiallie, ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be a body, if it be not in place: wherin bicauſe they could not Aunſwere to the argumente, they haue cut of that which was againſt them.</p>
               <p>The foure next Articles, are woorthy of no newe Replie,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12892:101"/>
and therefore we ſende the Readers to that which hath bene ſayd before: only, it is a great matter that the miniſters hold that a miracle can not be done in the bodye of Ieſus Chriſte, without chaunge of his nature, impoſing that opinion vppon <hi>Iuſtine,</hi> who (as well as other Auncientes) hathe ſayde and maintained, that the body of Ieſus Chriſte, without chaunge of nature, did paſſe thorowe the doores, although the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the miracle was done in the nature of the bodye, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chaunging it, but in giuing it a qualitie and ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, aboue the natural qualities of a body, that is ſuttelty.</p>
               <p>With like boldneſſe, the miniſters call the Scripture for the place of the Camell to paſſe thorowe the eie of a néedle, a parable and ſimilitude: as they doe that of the ſupper, and al others which reſiſt their errors: and to eſcape, they ſay, that God ſaues not the riche man, if he be not chaunged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted: And ſo they ſay, he can not bring to paſſe that a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell paſſe thorowe the eie of a néedle withoute diminution and chaunge of his greatneſſe: But the miniſters doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhe, that when oure Lord ſpake of the entrie of a Riche man into the kingdome of Heauen, he put not the difficultie proprely in the entrie to the kingdome, but in the conuerſion of the Riche man, whereby he may obtaine the entrie and poſſeſſion of Heauen: wherfore when our Lord ſayth that it is more eaſie to God, to make a Camell (or Cable) enter by the eye of a Néedle, than a Riche man into the kingdome of heauen: he meanes to compare the conuerſion of a riche man (which is impoſſible to men) to the paſſage of a Camell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his groſeneſſe: otherwayes as there ſhould be no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoode of difficultie, ſo our Lorde would not ſay, that ſuche a thing was impoſſible to men: We ſay further, that we haue not produced this place, as to proue the penetration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions proprely, but to ſhew that God may bring to paſſe that a body occupie a place, which ſhall not be proportioned to his greatneſſe: which is as muche againſte the nature of groſe and thicke bodies, as that one body be in diuers places.</p>
               <p>Where the miniſters glory, in that they are not conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confeſſe any thing of the doings of God alleaged oute
<pb facs="tcp:12892:102"/>
of the ſcripture by the Doctors: it foloweth not that the ſaid Doctors haue broughte forthe vaine reaſons to enforce and conuince them, referring themſelues to the Actes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: And touching to know if God could do ſuch miracles alleaged aboue the nature of a body, the miniſters can not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, what euaſion ſo euer they pretend, that they are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced to haue denyed as well the power as the fact: though not openly, yet at the leaſt couertly: For affirming that God can not bring to paſſe that one body be in diuers places, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it dothe impugne the order he hathe eſtabliſhed in the worlde, his wiſdome alſo and his will, which diſpoſe all by good order, and that it was againſt the nature of the bodie: if there may be as muche ſaide, as truely there may, of all the other things mentioned touching a body, with like reaſons: in confeſſing the one, they muſt neceſſarily confeſſe all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as containing like reaſon, wherunto the miniſters haue ſecretely accorded, being not able to giue any difference, nor ſhewe why God can not doe the one, and be able to doe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And albeit they will neuer confeſſe the debt, nor yelde as ouercome, as they vaunt, yet there is no maruell, ſeeing it is the nature of Heretikes to become obſtinate, and reſiſt the truthe, what reaſons ſo euer are proponed: The Scribes and Phariſies neuer confeſſed to be ouercome of the Lord, notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>The miniſters labor in vaine to produce much Gréeke, to ſhew that <hi>penetrare coelos,</hi> ſignifieth not to paſſe the Heauens without opening, bicauſe this verbe, <hi>Dierchestai</hi> is found to paſſe where is opening: But we neuer ſaid that <hi>penetrare,</hi> or <hi>Dierchestai</hi> can not be applied to places opened, or that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening them, they were pierced thorow: For we know in all Authors that doth encounter: We ſaid, that as the miniſters would inferre the Reall opening of the heauen by the rigor and propretie of the verbe <hi>aperire,</hi> ſo might they alleage that the heauens were ſhutte in the Aſcention of Ieſus Chriſte by the verbes <hi>Dierchestai,</hi> and <hi>penetrare,</hi> ſignifying with rigor, to pierce or paſſe thorowe, without that of it ſelfe, it importe opening, notwithſtanding it may be vſed, where is a place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: But by the rigour of their ſignification, opening can not be neceſſarily inferred, if, by ſome woorde, from elſe where, or euident condition of the thing that is pierced, the opening be not ſhewed: as it is in the textes alleaged by the miniſters: In the Aſcention theſe Verbes <hi>Dierchestai</hi> and <hi>penetrare</hi> be vſed, as to pierce, neither is any woord added, which imports diuiſion of the heauens: whoſe condition, nor the eſtate of the glorified bodie of Ieſus Chriſte, doe not enforce any neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnderſtanding of opening to be made, to ſuffer the ſaide body of Chriſte to enter.</p>
               <p>Therfore we argued of the rigor of <hi>penetrare,</hi> as the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters did of the wreſting of <hi>aperwe,</hi> which is founde in the ſcripture, and not to ſignifie a Reall opening of the heauens, more often than <hi>penetrare</hi> is red in the Scripture to ſignifie diuiſion or actuall ſeperation of the heauens: for <hi>eperire coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> is founde very often for ſpirituall and imaginatiue ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and <hi>penetrare coelos,</hi> is ſcarcely euer taken for actuall diuiſion of the Heauens.</p>
               <p>And therfore better was our reaſon to conclude by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the verbe <hi>Dierchestai,</hi> or <hi>penetrare</hi> (to paſſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out actual diuiſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauens) than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters to infer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opening of

               <p>In the laſt Article, the miniſters obiecte to vs to haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer certaine places of ſcripture, by which appeares that Faithe is a woorke of God: whereunto we ſay, that in ſome of our wrytings we haue expreſly confeſſed that Faithe, in that it is a gifte of God, is a woorke of God. But in that he that beléeues, woorkes with God in beléeuing, (for <hi>Nemo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit niſi volens</hi>) it is a humaine worke: and it is not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, one ſelfe woorke, for diuers conſiderations, to be a woorke of God, and a woorke of man. And where they bring the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes to haue ſayde (if not in propretermes, yet in like) that God can not bring to paſſe that a body be in diuers places: that is falſe: for they neuer either coulde or can ſhewe it, as alſo they gaineſay their laſte wryting: for, bringing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Auncientes ſaide it not in expreſſe termes, they alleaged it was bicauſe they neuer thoughte ſuche abſurditie coulde fall into the braine of man: which reaſon oughte to take place, as well to ſpeake it in termes like, as in expreſſe termes, ſéeing it is one ſelfe thing ſignified as wel by the one as by the other.</p>
               <p>For the reſt: the miniſters neuer Aunſwere to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, whereof they haue bene often warned, and eftſoones we doe admoniſhe them, although they terme a thouſande times our ſpéeche, matter of repetition: it is, that we require them to bring ſcripture to proue that it impugnes the order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the world, the truthe, wiſdome, omnipotencie, and immoueable wil of God, one body to be in two places: which they can not doe, but Aunſwere according to their cuſtome, nothing: wherein may be diſcerned, that their Doctrine is not founded vppon Gods woorde, but vpon their propre opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; or particulare inſpiration, which can not be but of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: for being contrary to the common conſent of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Churche, it can not be of the holy Ghoſt. And vppon the ſame are founded alſo the other Articles of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, albeit they diſguiſe and promiſſe at euery woord, the word of God.</p>

               <head>A short aduertiſement of the Doctors vpon the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Ministers touching the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of God.</head>
               <p>WE maruaile of the maner of ſpéeche and writing vſed by the Miniſters, who ſince the beginning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, could neuer endure to purſue &amp; conclude one onelye point, without entermedling of others which belonged no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the matter of the queſtion as maye appeare by the reading of their Actes: Wherein afore they ſet downe their reſolution of Gods omnipotencie, they heaped together as many Articles as they coulde remember, and thruſt them one vppon an other, withoute occaſion and reaſon. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (vpon their owne requeſt) we had ſet afore them articles of the Supper: yea to the intent that after we had diſputed of the almightyneſſe of God (to make preſent the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt in the holye Sacrament) we might diſcende by order into the declaration and proofe, that ſuche was Gods wyll, and alſo that he is there: But we are not ignorant of the good cuſtomes of thoſe of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion pretended reformed, to blow in the eyes of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, all the articles of their religion, together with the polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they inuent thereupon all vppon one lyne, to the ende nothing be determined, but all reſt in confuſion, and that the Serpent runne away when he hath vomited his poyſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides by the obſeruation of their aunſwers, it is to bée diſcerned, that they neuer reſted vpon any certaine and ſelfe aunſwer: But to euerye queſtion they haue returned aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers no leſſe diuers than impertinent, and ſometimes not to be ſuffered: of the which we giue warning to all ſuche as ſhall reade the conferences, and laying our ſelues vppon their iudgement, beſéeche them to haue good regard to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of the Miniſters ſide.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we tell the Miniſters, that either they may or ought to know, that all the ſectes of our time bleare the eyes of ſuch as they meane to blinde with the ſelfe ſame traine of articles which they haue gathered together in their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that to obtaine audience in the catholike Churche,
<pb facs="tcp:12892:104"/>
and to bring in theyr errours and hereſies vnder the name of Gods glory. Of the which they vaunt them ſelues to be protectors no leſſe than the Miniſters: wherein, lyke as notwithſtandyng all theſe, they are not to be receiued or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in their opinions and concluſions, ſo the Miniſters ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not pretend any right to exalt the power &amp; glorye of God by ſuch a confuſion and hotchpotche of all matters together.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we let the Miniſters vnderſtande that wyth better reaſon we could returne vppon them the concluſion they pretende to inferre of the ſubtiltye and art of Sathan, the ſame being (as they write) that vnder a godlye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of pietie, Sathan (in the maner of a Serpent) ſlides into the Church of God, to the ende to plant their diſorder, and at laſt to ſet vpon euen God himſelfe. Let euerye one ſée and conſider in himſelfe, if this be not the true enterpriſe of the Miniſters, both by their deductions, and generallye the principall poyntes of their doctrine. For vnder a farie pretence to roote vp certayne abuſes and errours, whiche falſely they ſéeke to perſuade the world to be in the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, againſt Gods word, and vnder colour of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that they ſearche to exalt the name of the Lord, they go about to diſpoyle God of hys properties and perfections, notwithſtanding they declare it not, no more than Sathan opened his intent to the firſt man.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters beſides deface the merite and efficacye of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and by their doctrine open the gate to all vices and ſynne. For proofe wherof, albeit we ſhould ſpare to repeate what they haue holden of the power of God, yet their writinges ſtand as their accuſers: onelye in good reſolution (although they vtter faire ſpéeche) God can doe no more, as they holde, than it pleaſeth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of hys wyſedome and wyll, which they diſguiſe after their ſenſe, when it is founde declared in the ſcripture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the bountye of God they hold, that he is author and worker of euyll and ſynne. Againſt his mercy they teache that he neyther doth nor wyll pardon a man that hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by malice the knowledge of the truth, or reſiſted it.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12892:104"/>
Againſt the merite of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and paſſion of the croſſe, they haue written in proper tearmes, that if Ieſus Chriſt had dyed onelye by the anguiſhes of corporall death, and the effuſion of all his bloud, he had done nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited nothing for our redemption: If being vpon the croſſe, and afore hys death, he had not endured the payne of the damned in his ſoule, with other horrible blaſphemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the article of his diſcention in to hell.</p>
               <p>They inſtruct alſo their adherentes, that manſlaughter, adultery, robbery, theft, ſacriledge and all other crime what ſoeuer, are but veniall ſynnes to the predeſtinate, whom they ſay are neuer out of Gods grace, whatſoeuer they do. Aſſuring their faythfull, and ſuch as ſtand in their Church, to beleue conſtantly that they be in grace, and predeſtinate, which in playne ſpéeche (though they would otherwyſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it) is to giue full licence to do all euyll: With ſundry other articles whiche we intende to verifie, as the matter requires. But if they denye theſe poyntes to bée wrytten and publiſhed in their ſecte, the places in <hi>Calums</hi> bookes, which we haue noted in the Margent, are to giue witneſſe. In effect that is the glorye of God, and hys Sonne Ieſus Chriſt whereunto the Miniſters incline and tende, by the extirping of the pretended impieties mencioned in manye articles of their laſt reſolution.</p>
               <p>To aunſwer the which in ſhort ſpéeche, we ſaye, that ſome are ſpitefullye and falſelye layed vppon the catholyke Churche by the Miniſters, others be expreſſelye written in holye Scripture, and others drawne out of the ſame, and confirmed by the tradition of the Apoſtles, and vniuerſall conſent of the firſt Chriſtian churche: except the ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous impoſitions which in euery article the Miniſters doo adde. And ſo in tyme and place we wyll declare and proue by péecemeale, if the pacience of the Miniſters wyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to handle euerye difficultie in hys place. But if they continue to cauell withall to put confuſion in the doctrine, we proteſt to aunſwer them with ſcoffes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:105"/>For the reſt, they bable much of Gods power in general, alledging that we ought to take certaine knowledge of it by the Scriptures, whiche wée haue alwayes aduowed vnto them. They ſay alſo that it is infinite and incomprehenſible, but when we offer particularities, to knowe wherein omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie conſiſtes, then they forget the holye ſcriptures, and without them meaſure it according to the wiſdome and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wyll of God, and the order eſtabliſhed in the world: yea and as if they were without all remembraunce, that that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightyneſſe were infinite, they wreſt it to a condition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, and naturall order of creatures: as if to do anye thing againſt or aboue the order, condition and naturall propertye of the ſayd creatures, were a thing repugnaunt to the wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nature, and wyll of God. This is the ſhort reſolution which we may gather of their opinion touching the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie of God, the ſame appearing in their papers and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers giuen to vs, wherin, touching <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> produced by them, we haue ſufficiently aunſwered before.</p>
               <p>Where the Miniſters lay vpon vs to hold as a ſufficient argument, that a caſe being done of God, declares that hée could do it, we referre our ſelues to our writinges, whereof our reſolution and obiections containe all the contrarye.</p>
               <p>We are alſo ſlaundered by the Miniſters, to affirme that faith contrarieth nature euery way: onely we ſayd, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the contradiction done to fayth, founded vppon the worde, procéedes of the conſideration of thinges naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of God.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſcripture of <hi>Geneſis</hi> wytneſſeth alwayes, that hée and hys wyſe made a certaine difficultye touching the promiſe of God: and conſidered <hi>corpus ſuum emortuum, et mortuam vuluam Sar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12892:105"/>
which had bene made to him.</p>
               <p>We ſay, we haue better concluded touching the fayth we ought to haue of the power of God (to make one body in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places) than the Miniſters, who haue no woord of God to aſſure their faith and beliefe that God cannot do it, or that it impugnes his wiſedome, prouidence, and eternall vertue, or the humanitie of Ieſus Chriſt, yea onely the nature of a ſimple body: But touching all this, the Miniſters truſte in their preſumption and particular reuelation, without one onely place of the ſcripture, whereupon they maye ſettle or reſt their opinion: Where, of the contrary we haue groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our faith (not onely touching the power of God, to bring to paſſe that a body be in diuers places, but alſo to beleue the fact, and that God would it ſo) vpon the holye Scripture, as appeares in our reſolution, together with the places of the auncientes alledged for that purpoſe, the ſame being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that as the Miniſters are not able to gainſay them, ſo touching their eſcapes, they are to be conuinced by the ſimple reading of the bookes.</p>
               <p>Touching the reſidue of the Miniſters reſolution (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining many iniuries, ſlaunders, and wronges againſt vs) we aunſwer nothing, hauing regarde to the maner of theyr doinges. Like as alſo we conſider, it ſhould be but paine loſt to teache the Miniſters, who for their inſtruction, eſteeme more their particular reuelation, than all the doctrine of the vniuerſall church, and all the Chriſtians together. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we pardon them with all our heartes, at the wrongs they haue done vs, as beyng people eſtraunged from their full ſenſe, and without iudgement, which they well declare by the maner of their doing.</p>

               <head>The Doctors obiection touching the Supper against the Aunſwer of the Ministers.</head>
               <p>IT appeares ſufficiently in the actes of the firſt dayes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, why in the beginning of the conferences, we tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not the articles of the ſupper: wherein the Miniſters
<pb facs="tcp:12892:106"/>
do maliciouſly ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der vs, in ſaying we refuſed to enter into the matter of the ſame: as is truly proued, as well by our ſundry offers made to them to conferre thereof verbally, to the ende to aduaunce it with more ſpéede, and ſo at leyſure to ſet it downe in writing (which the Miniſters refuſed) as alſo by our former obiections touching the article of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightyneſſe. By theſe we touched the groundes, wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are builded the errours of the religion pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, againſt the reall preſence of the body and bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the holy Sacrament. The ſame being to be iuſtified further, in that wée obiect to them certayne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes agaynſt their Supper, the rather to make them enter into it: To the whiche eyther they haue aunſwered nothing at all, or at leaſt ſo impertinentlye, that euen the woordes of their aunſwer diſcouer their diſpoſition to flée the combat. As yet they continue by their laſt writings, hiding, ſo farre as they can, that which they thinke of the ſupper: notwithſtanding they haue bene required to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer both to purpoſe and truth. But whether they or wée refuſed, the effect ſtandes to iudge. For though they wyll not aunſwer, yet we wyll not forbeare to aduiſe them, and reueale to the whole world the intollerable errours, aſwell in the Supper, as in all the doctrine of the Miniſters: Who being aſked, yet dare not confeſſe and iuſtifie what hath bene written by the inuenters of their ſupper.</p>
               <p>But now to begyn to ſpeake of the ſupper, the Miniſters mayntaine it celebrated, according to the ordinaunce of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and maner with the Apoſtels, vſed in all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche, when ſhe flooriſhed, and whyleſt ſhe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her pureneſſe.</p>
               <p>Whereunto we aunſwer with this queſtion, howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye worldes they thinke that the doctrine hath remayned in her pureneſſe touching the Supper, and whether as then the Church ſtood not as pure in the doctrine of al the other Articles, as in this? Beſides, whether ſince that tyme there was not found any place through the whole worlde, where
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12892:106"/>
the true doctrine of the ſupper, and the other Articles, was retayned and preſerued? As alſo in what place, and by whom, from world to world, it was preached and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? In theſe we deſire to be ſatiſfied by the Miniſters, as importing muche, bicauſe that afore <hi>Caluin</hi> preferred hys Catechiſme, there was no memorye in any Region of ſuche doctrine as he taught, neither was the ſupper celebrated in the maner it is now in the reformed Church.</p>
               <p>And we woulde gladlye relieue the Miniſters, who in their writinges ſéeme ſtraungelye paſſioned, that we haue ſayde that their Supper differs not from a common Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, ſauing that it is woorſe, as beyng prophane and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</p>
               <p>But to encounter this, they make a great ſpeake of all the action of their ſayde Supper, and by goodlye acceſſories, carying a forme of all pietie, they labour to make it highlye commended: couering a goodly nothing betwene two plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And of the contrarye to treade downe and deface the moſt precious ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt in the Maſſe, by tearing in péeces ſome acceſſorye of the ſame, as though wée vſed it without reaſon and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche the Miniſters eyther vnderſtande not, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble not to vnderſtande.</p>
               <p>But as thynges ought not to be taken and eſtéemed by their acceſſories, but according to their value, nature, and truth: ſo the Miniſters haue to foreſee, that all the ſectes ſtanding at this day in all the worlde againſt the catholike Churche, for the matter of the Sacrament, vſe at leaſt thys brauerie that they do. Who if they were aſked, there is not one of them which would not enforce to proue, that their ſect approcheth nearer Ieſus Chriſt, hys Apoſtels, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche, than the Religion pretended reformed. Touching all which, we referre our ſelues to the writinges of the <hi>Lutherians, Zwinglians, Anabaptiſtes, Trinitaries,</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Alaſco,</hi> with other lyke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:107"/>Therefore it is not reaſonable by theſe faire voyces and ſpeeches, to preferre the ſupper of the Miniſters afore other ſectes, with iudgement that it is good, holye, impoluted, and according to gods word: but rather to repute it infected and defiled with impietie, as couering a dreame in place of truth, and giues the acceſſaries of pietie, to impietye and falſhoode. Neither haue we diſprayſed their Supper, for the thankes they giue to God, or in reſpect of their confeſſion of ſinnes, or their preaching (if it containe matter of truth) or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparatiue: But in this haue we named it to be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, as not containing but common bread and wyne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ordinaunce of Ieſus Chriſt: and yet they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto it ſome ſpirituall effect, with other goodly acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of pietie: the ſame being a matter of more abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and inuented by Sathan, who ſéekes by ſuche maner of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to quenche and aboliſh the true ſupper according to the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, and rob the faythfull of the fruite and truth of the ſaid true ſupper, in making them giue onely common bread, in place of the body and bloud of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Here we could recite the wicked acceſſories, as well as they ſpeake of the goodly, which are in their ſupper, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and newe enterpriſes which are practiſed vnder colour and ſhaddowe of the aſſemblies drawne together at their ſayd ſupper: but leaſt the Miniſters reproche vs, that the Clerke ſpeake of weapons, of contributions. &amp;c. we wyll al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hold our peace, and referre our ſelues to that which is: contenting our ſelues to deduce certayne cauſes, by the which we maintaine that there is no truth in the ſayd Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, according to the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that in the ſupper of the Miniſters and their lykes, there cannot be made any conſecration of the matter of the bread &amp; wyne, which are there propoſed: and therfore there is not made in the ſayd matter anye mutation either before the vſe, or in the vſe, or after, and by conſequence, that the bread and wine in that Supper cannot be but common.</p>
               <p>That there is no conſecration made in their Supper, it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12892:107"/>
appeares firſt by this, that it belongs not to al perſons to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the bread and the wine in the ſupper: but only to ſuch as are lawfully ordained by the impoſition of the handes of the Paſtors and Biſhoppes, according to the ſucceſſion ſince the Apoſtles till our time. And it is moſte certaine that the moſt parte of the miniſters of the ſuppoſed reformed church, are not ordained by the authoritie of the handes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, who haue power by ſucceſſion of one to an other, ſince the Apoſtles: So that we muſt conclude, that ſuche miniſters vſurping the office that pertaines not to them, can not make any conſecration, and by conſequence, they giue but common bread and wine: of which Article ſhall be ſpoken, when we handle the ſacrifice, and prieſthoode.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to make conſecration of bread and wine, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſeth not that the perſon be fit to conſecrate the matter, but it is alſo neceſſary, that by a certaine meane the lawfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter make the conſecration, which is, by Benediction and pronuntiation of certaine woordes vpon the matters propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as Ieſus Chriſte did firſte obſerue, wherein, bicauſe the miniſters, albeit they were lawfully ordained, and had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power to conſecrate, do not vſe Benediction and pronuntiation of certaine woordes vppon the Breade and Wine, (impugning firſt that which Ieſus Chriſte did, and after left it to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſoures to doe ſo) they can not pretende any conſecration of the Breade and Wine, nor that in them doe come any mutation: whereof it foloweth, that as they differre not from other Breade and Wine, ſo that banket and feaſt is but common, and that it is blaſphemie to attribute to it the name of Chriſtian Supper: And this is a partie cauſe, why we ſaid the miniſters ſupper was a banket prophane and polluted.</p>
               <p>We haue required the miniſters to Aunſwere pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully, to our Demaundes, which bicauſe they haue not done, to the ende to intercept all vaine trauaile, we thinke it not good for the preſent to impugne their Aunſweres: only we ſummon them eftſoones to Aunſwere that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to them, without ſhifting of the conference which they
<pb facs="tcp:12892:108"/>
pretend to holde in ſo deare regarde.</p>
               <p>The firſt Demaund was general for all the Sacraments to wéete, if the miniſters beléeued that two things were eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and neceſſary to the confection of the Sacramente: which are: the matter or element, and the woorde: the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Anſwere, that the Sacrament conſidered in his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, conſiſts in thrée things. &amp;c. they ſpeake in determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that it can not be iudged, if their ſpéeche vnderſtand the Sacrament only, which they call of the Supper, or general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all, as they were aſked: albeit in reſpecte they alleage <hi>Ireneus,</hi> it may be eaſily geſſed that they meane not but the Sacrament of the Supper: we haue alſo to note the woordes of their Addition, <hi>conſidered in his perfection,</hi> as alwayes to haue a hole to créepe out when we ſpeake of the eſſence of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>We demaunde that they Anſwere to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned in general of all the Sacramentes, ſéeing there is like reaſon touching the eſſence of the Sacraments in generall: and that alſo they declare openly, what things are eſſentiall and neceſſary in the Sacrament, to be made a Sacramente, without ſpeaking for the preſent of the perfection of one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, containing the eſſence and ſpirituall frutes, which are not of the eſſence of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſeconde Demaund, the Miniſters Anſwere no more pertinently, than to the firſte: And ſpecially, where we made a Demaunde that certaine woordes muſte be vſed for the confection of the Sacramente, and what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Sacramente of the Supper: the miniſters haue ſayde, that the baſe and ſecrete ſpeeche of certaine woordes addreſſed to the Elementes, was not a neceſſary ſpeeche to the confection of the ſacrament: We did not Demaund whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſpéeche ſhould be pronounced high or lowe.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion was, if there be any neceſſary ſpéeches to make the ſacrament, which ought to be pronounced vpon the matter, or in adminiſtring the matter: and what might be thoſe woordes for the ſupper: wherin it is not inoughe to ſay, that the word by the which the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12892:108"/>
is declared, is the woorde of the ſacrament, But they muſte Anſwere in what woordes that ſpeeche conſiſtes, and when it ought to be pronounced.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſixthe Demaunde which is the principall, the miniſters care not to Anſwere pertinently and clearely: only they exhibite a captious Anſwer, by which it can not be perceiued what is their opinion of the preſence and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the body of Ieſus Chriſte in the ſupper: And ſo doe they temper their ſpéeche, that there is neither <hi>Zuinglian,</hi> nor <hi>Almaniſt,</hi> which confeſſeth not as muche or more than they, that is to ſay, that they are conioyned to our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, and that they poſſeſſe him ii. vertue of their Faithe, and by the operation of the holy Ghoſte, as to be made fleſhe of his fleſhe, and bones of his bones. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But it is farre from the queſtion, which was, if in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the ſupper, the Faithfull receiue in their ſoules, beſides all the ſpirituall graces (amongſt the which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with our Lord Ieſus Chriſte) the true bodie and the true bloude of him, Really, truely, and touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: And if in the ſupper, the Miniſters make not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſubſtance contained and perceiued in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the frutes and effects which procéede therof: And to be ſhort, we aſke, if the Miniſters receiue and allowe, that which <hi>Caluine</hi> in his Catechiſme, Inſtitution &amp; other Bokes hathe written of the Supper, and that whiche is receiued therein.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſeuenth Demaund, the Miniſters haue not vnderſtand what was proponed to them, touching the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitance: for they haue taken it as if the Demaund ran, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was lawful to receiue the ſacrament, vnder one kind or not: which was not ment nor put in queſtion: onely this was the difficultie that was proponed to them, whether in their ſupper, when the bread is receiued, and afore the wine be receiued, they participate really with the true body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, and not participate with his bloud, till they haue taken the wine, or, whether, in eating the bread, the bodie be receiued, afore the cuppe be taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:109"/>To which Demaundes, to the ende Paper be not ſpente and moiled for nothing, we admoniſhe the miniſters to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere without ſwaruing or varietie, and yelde open Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Faithe: And that we may knowe what Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we may impugne or approue.</p>
               <p>Touching the Articles of the Maſſe, we reſerue them to their propre places, which is of the Sacrifice of the body and bloud of Ieſus Chriſte, after it be knowne and proued that they are preſent in the ſupper, and holy ſacrament.</p>

               <p>In the firſt place, we denie to haue impoſed vpon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that they haue drawne and reſtrained the Church into a certaine place, but rather to a certaine company, and to the traditions giuen, folowed, and approued by the ſame: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we praiſe God, that the ſaide Doctoures are come now to acknowledge that the Catholike Churche ſtretcheth thorow oute all the world, and that it is not encloſed within bounds
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12892:109"/>
and limites of the authoritie and traditions of the Romiſhe Churche: which as we confeſſe was highly eſtéemed of the Auncients, when errors, abuſes, and vices did not abounde in it, (as is happened ſince.) So nowe, being ſo corrupted as well in manners as in Doctrine, as nothing is more hateful than the woorde of God, the light, the truthe, and vertue: we ſay, that as the eſtate of the ſaide Churche hathe bene chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo alſo oughte the value and reputation, wherin it hathe dwelt: And yet in what degree of honour ſo euer it hath ben raiſed in times paſſed, the Auncients neuer eſtéemed it an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Churche nor hir Biſhop, an vniuerſall Biſhop: as appeareth by that which <hi>S.

                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:110"/>Touching the omnipotencie of God, and the Diffinition we haue laide of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, drawne out of <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> bookes: the Doctors in their laſte wryting inferre no newe thing, to driue vs from it: For, that which they alleage of the Angels, to be able to doe what they will, and therefore to be almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as well as God (if the diffinition aforeſaide of Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe had place) is no Example either to the preſente purpoſe, or to proue that there is in Angels, a power equall with God: ſéeing it is moſt certaine that their wil and power depende elſewhere, and that God rules ouer them, to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, ſuſpende, and ſtay them, as it pleaſeth him, and as he can doe to all other creatures: which can not be ſaide of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blaſphemie. But, be it in what ſorte ſo euer, if they will reprehende the diffinition of Gods almightineſſe proponed by vs, it is not with vs, but with <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> that they haue to doe: for the ſaide diffinition was taken woorde by woorde out of his wrytings.</p>
               <p>We muche maruell, that, hauing ſo amplie aduouched to them our opinion of the omnipotencie of God, with declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it ſtretched indifferently to all things which mens fonde fanſies coulde conceiue or imagine, that yet they will eftſoones regrate vpon that pointe, alleaging that God can do wiſely that, which the fooliſhe imagine fondly.</p>
               <p>For it is moſte manifeſt that Fooles may imagine many things which are impoſſible to God: As, (for example) that God is not, as is written in the Pſalme <hi>.14.</hi> and <hi>.53.</hi> that he is corporall as the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> did déeme: that the worlde is eternall as the <hi>Peripaticiens</hi> did teache that there be two Princes, as the <hi>Manicheans</hi> held: All which things can not be attributed to the omnipotencie of God withoute blaſphemie: But in this are we beſt contented, that touching this Article, our maiſters after long and ſharpe debate, with ſo many blaſphemies euen when we ſtoode in the truthe of it, are yet conſtrained in the ende to conſent with vs, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the interpretation and reſtriction which we gaue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Goddes omnipotencie, as appeareth by one ſpeeche of their laſt wryting, whoſe woordes be theſe: All things (ſay

they) that are to be imagined of man, are to be done of God, without excepting any thing, but ſuche as implie contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be and not to be.</p>
               <p>Then what reaſon is there, that for ſuche things wherein they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to vs which be excepted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods almightineſſe, that we for excepting them ſhoulde be guiltie in blaſphemie and not the Doctoures, who ſay and confeſſe the ſelfe ſame thing: This propoſition, that a naturall bodie (euen that of Ieſus Chriſte) is in diuers places at one inſtante, is of the numbre of thoſe things which implie contradiction, as hathe bene already ſufficiently proued: therfore we conclude that the omnipotencie of God oughte not to be referred and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſo farre.</p>
               <p>The Doctoures charge vs afterwardes with foure horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemies as they terme them: grounding them vppon our opinion, defending that one body can not be in diuers places at one inſtante, as to reſiſte the truthe, wiſdome and omnipotencie of God: this the Doctoures finde ſo ſtraunge and farre from reaſon that they diſdain to refute it, thinking it is vnworthy of Anſwere, and that only it ſuffiſeth to recite it: whereunto we Anſwere that to ſay it is a blaſphemie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Anſwer, is an eaſie and moſt ready mean to ſhake of all difficulties wherwith they may be entangled.</p>
               <p>The Doctoures are alſo importunate with vs, to bring foorthe by Goddes woorde that one body can not be in diuers places at one inſtante, whereunto we Anſwer once againe, that it belongs to the Doctours to proue the contrary by one text of the ſcripture: that one body may be in one inſtante in diuers places, ſéeing they are proponantes, and we reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in this conference.</p>
               <p>And yet we haue declared héere before, by liuely reaſons drawne out of the ſcripture, and eſſential propreties of God, the nature of bodies, &amp; the Authoritie of the fathers, that the matter of the queſtion is altogither impoſſible: and touching their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t containing this nature &amp; form, God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> change the order which he hath eſtabliſhed in nature, then he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo

bring to paſſe that one bodie, at one time, be in many places: we denie the conſequence, and by this reaſon: ſuche a caſe would not only chaunge the order, but alſo woulde intangle contradiction, which, euen by the Confeſſion of the Doctors, is out of the omnipotencie of God.</p>
               <p>In the Article folowing, they doe the ſame which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche in vs, as darkening that, which we clearely proponed in our laſt wryting: by meane whereof, if they will that we Anſwere them at large, let them vnfolde it better.</p>
               <p>Where the Doctors accuſe vs to haue malitiouſly concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this woord, place, in the matter of circumſcription of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy meaſured, we ſay it was not néedeful to vſe that woord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly there, bicauſe there is no man ſo ignorant, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that a body is circumſcripte, inferreth not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly that then he is comprehended in a certaine place.</p>
               <p>Touching the Camell, if they ſuffice not with that hathe bene already ſaide, let him read againe <hi>S.

of truth, the ſame being the occaſion that we cannot approue either the argumentes or the concluſions of the Doctours, touching one body to be in many places at one inſtant: being moſt aſſured by good and certaine teſtimonies of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all that they go about to proue, proceedes not from other where, than of the ſpirite of errour and lyes: Who by this meanes labours to retayne the impietie and idolatrye, which heretofore he hath eſtabliſhed in the world, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction almoſt of all Chriſtendome.</p>

               <p>To proue that faith comes partlie of our ſelues, and not wholy of God, the Doctors alledge that no man beleues <hi>niſi volens</hi> (which is that no man beleues but willingly) we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that (vnder correction of our Maiſters) that is to euyll purpoſe, bicauſe ſuche wyll and conſent are of God, who workes in the faithfull the wyll and well doyng, the ſame being very well taught by <hi>S.

make of the ſlaunders there committed, the care we haue to diſcouer, reprehende, and correct them: the payne we take to reforme what is there diſordered, the publike prayers we make in all places to that ende, defende vs towardes all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, and iuſtifie vs agaynſt the ſlaunders of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The ſeconde is, that the Doctors abuſe their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, in ſaying that <hi>Abraham</hi> doubted of the promiſe, the ſame beyng all together contrarye to the opinion of the Apoſtle in the fourth to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> where he ſayth in proper tearmes, he made no doubt of the promiſe of God by diſtruſt, but was ſtrengthened by faith, giuing glory to God.</p>
               <p>To aunſwer the laſt obiection of the Doctors made (as they ſay) againſt our aunſwere giuen to their former que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion vpon the matter of the ſupper: how ſoeuer they fayne not to haue delayed the conference and diſputation of the Supper and the Maſſe, yet they are not able to perſuade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of any iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that hetherunto they haue not alwaies, and yet do not ſhift off to enter into it.

               <p>The which when wée well perceiued, contayning not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our deſire, not to depart from them, tyll wée had firſt conferred therein. We often proteſted not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute further with them, if thoſe two articles were not firſt decided and reſolued. To which ende we proponed certaine argumentes, as well of the one as the other, by order and good Methode: to the end they might aduiſe what they wold oppugne and gaynſay in the ſayd argumentes.

There be two principall cauſes of this fayth, the one is outward,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.13</note> and the other inwarde. The inwarde is the holy ſpirite, which is called a ſpirite of faith, bicauſe he is the author thereof, and hath created and produced it in the hearts of men, inclining and diſpoſing them to receiue in all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the worde and promiſe of God, preached vnto them by the faithfull Executors and Miniſters of the ſame,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> whiche word is the externall cauſe of faith. And as this faith increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and riſeth by degrées, ſo doth alſo the vnitie wée haue with Ieſus Chriſt, and (by this meane) with God: vntyll as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith, that we concurre and méete all together in the vnitie of the faith and knowledge of the ſonne of God in perfect man, in the maner of a perfect ſtature of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This encreaſe of faith comes by the operation and vertue of the holy ſpirite, which was the originall and firſt author of it. And then after by the continuance of the worde purely preached and pronounced. And laſtly by the lawfull vſe of the Sacramentes, prouided as ſeales for the certaintye and confirmation of the fayth, and aſſurance which we haue of the ſayde coniunction with God by Ieſus Chriſt, together with participation of all the benefites, grauntes, giftes, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and bleſſinges, which are purchaſed for vs by his fauour, as remiſſion of ſynnes, our regeneration, and mortification of the fleſh with his concupiſcence. For the better ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which thinges, and to aſſure vs of the exhibition and vſe of the ſame, Baptiſme was ordayned of God, to the ende that in the water ſprinkled vpon our bodies, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God added therewith, we may behold (as wyth our eyes) the inuiſible grace which God doth to vs, to waſh vs,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12892:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and make vs cleane of our ſpirituall ordures, and ſo to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vs and make vs new creatures: as alſo to aſſure vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallye of the eternall lyfe, and make vs encreaſe in the hope we haue by our participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh of Ieſus Chriſt crucified for our redemption, and of his bloud ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſynnes: The bread and wyne are diſtributed to vs in the ſupper, by the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But as we acknowledge an vnitie and ſacramentall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction betwene the exterior ſigne, and the thing ſignified by it: ſo we ſaye of the other ſide, that betwene them both there is ſuch a diſtinction, that the one ought not to be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the other: neither the ſpirituall thing ſo tyed to the corporall (which repreſentes it) that either the one without the other cannot be receiued, or by neceſſity they both bée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes indeuidablye knyt together: Whereof it followeth that ſuch are in errour who hold that in the ſupper the bread is tranſnatured into the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the body of Ieſus Chriſt. And likewiſe thoſe that ſay, it is there knit and vnited corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſo that who ſoeuer receiues &amp; takes thoſe ſignes, be he faithfull or infidel, takes and receiues immediately the thing ſignified by them. Which errour, wyth the moſte part of others crept in vpon this matter, hath proceeded, in that men haue not well comprehended what it is to eate the body, and drinke the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: which ought not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand as a maner that corporal meates are taken &amp; eaten, but onely of a ſpirituall faſhion, as is declared in the ſixt of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> which conſiſtes in that that Ieſus Chriſt dwelles in vs, and we in him, the ſame being done by the faith we haue in him. As <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> teacheth in his <hi>.25.</hi> treatiſe vpon <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> ſaying, why doeſt thou prepare thy belly and thy teeth? beleue, and thou haſt eaten it. Likewiſe in his third booke of Chriſtian doctrine, chap. <hi>16.</hi> as followeth: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, if you eate not the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you ſhall not haue lyfe in you. It ſeemes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes to commit a great crime: ſo that it is a figure, by the which we ought not vnderſtand other thing, but that we muſt communicate with the paſſion of the Lord, and kepe in
<pb facs="tcp:12892:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
memorie that his fleſh was crucified and wounded for vs.</p>
               <p>Then the eating of the fleſh and body of Ieſus Chriſt is no other thyng than a ſtraight coniunction and vnitie wée haue with hym: which is wrought by the fayth we repoſe in his promiſes, euen as by the mutuall promiſes made and receiued betwene a man and his wyfe, the mariage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes and is eſtabliſhed betwene them, wherein albeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo knit, they happen by any occaſion to be ſeperate and farre of one from the other touching their bodies, yet are they for all that one fleſh and one body by meane of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie and matrimoniall acquaintaunce betwene them. In like ſort, be it that Ieſus Chriſt (with whom we are knyt and vnited by faith and truſt we haue in him and in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) be, as in reſpect of his body, reſident in heauen, and we remaine here on earth, ſo that there is a great diſtance betwene him and vs touching his bodye: yet that doth not hinder vs to be fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of his bones, and that he is not our head, and we his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, he our huſband, and we his ſpouſe, that we are not of one ſelf body tyed with him, that we are not cloathed of him, and that we dwell not in him, as the braunches in the vine. Neither is there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time or place what ſoeuer it be, nor difference of ſeaſons, which may hinder that coniunction, &amp; that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eate truly his fleſh and blood. For as the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, notwithſtandyng they were two or three thouſande yeares afore Chriſt dyed, yet forbare not to communicate in his fleſh crucified, and eate the ſame meate ſpirituallye which we eate, and drinke the ſame drink ſpiritually which we drinke: ſo the faythfull alſo whiche are comen twelue or fiftene hundreth yeares after, forbeare not, in what place ſoeuer they be, to participate, as the Fathers, with the ſame meate and drinke which they did.</p>
               <p>Neither is there anye other difference betwene the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Fathers that were before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſuche as haue followed hym, but the reaſon of the more or of the leſſe, whiche is, that in the one there is more ample and expreſſe declaration of Gods good wyll to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12892:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, than in the other. By which we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that from the beginning of the world, vntyl the ende, there was neuer, nor euer ſhall be, other coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his Churche, than ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, that is, purchaſed by the ſpirite of God. For euen as there is but one fayth in the Fathers, and in vs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth alwayes on the one and other ſyde our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte: euen ſo are not wée conioyned with him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorte than they were. So that as the Fathers had no other ſocietie or communication then ſpirituall, euen ſo it followeth alſo that we neither are nor can be otherwiſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with him, than ſpiritually.</p>
               <p>And yet do we not ſay that we and the Fathers are not fleſhe of hys fleſh, and bones of his bones, &amp; that altogether we participate not as wel with his humanitie, as with his diuinitie. But all our ſaying and opinion ſtretcheth to this, that this participation which we haue there, is by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vertue of the holy ſpirite. Which Ieſus Chriſt in <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> ſpeaking of this coniunction,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 1. Cor. 10.</note> teacheth clearelye in theſe fewe wordes: the thinges whereof I ſpeake to you, are the ſpirite and life: as alſo <hi>S. Paule,</hi> our Fathers (ſayth he) haue eaten the ſame ſpirituall meate, and dronke the ſame ſpirituall drinke.</p>
               <p>Wherein when we ſpeake of thys ſpirituall eating both in vs and in our Fathers, it muſt not be thought therefore that we would reiect the holye Supper of the Lord, or once thinke, that in the ſame the vſe of breade and wyne is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: no more then the vſe of the water in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>For our Lorde, knowing the hardneſſe of our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, together wyth the infirmitie and weakeneſſe of oure hearts, and by a pitie &amp; compaſſion he hath of vs, ſeekyng to remedye the ſame, was not onely content to leaue vnto vs the miniſterie of hys word, to aſſure vs of the participation which we haue in hys fleſh and bloud, and all the benefites lykewyſe depending thereupon:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:115"/>But he hath alſo added thereunto the ſignes of breade and wyne, which he hath annexed to his word as ſeales to ſeale in our heartes, by the vſe of the ſame, the fayth which wée haue of the ſayd coniunction by his woord. Like as it dyd not ſuffiſe him to haue contracted the alliance with <hi>Abraham</hi> by the word and promiſe he made him, but he added further the ſigne of Circumciſion, as a ſeale to confirme and aſſure more amply the ſayd alliance.</p>
               <p>To the ende then that euery one vnderſtande what is the ſupper of the Lord, and alſo what we beleue and teach of it, ther muſt be conſidered and acknowledged in the ſame three thinges. Firſt, the ordinaunce of the Lord contayned in hys woorde, and declared by his Miniſter, according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. By the which word this holy ceremony was ordained and eſtabliſhed in the Churche, to edifie and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the members of the ſame: which muſt be diligentlye obſerued, as to haue it in ſuch honour and reuerence as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth, and not to put it on the beadroll or ſorte of other ceremonies, who haue no other ground or reaſon of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, than the onely wil and traditions of men: yet there muſt be héede taken, that by the inſtitution and ordinance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeake, ther is vnderſtanded a certaine pronunciation of words, or any vertue which is hid in them, as do the preſts of the Romiſh church, who by ignorance, and their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious opinion thinke to haue conſecrated and tranſubſtancia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bread and wyne which is in their Maſſe, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of fiue wordes, <hi>Hoc est enim corpus meum,</hi> breathed and pronounced vpon the elementes. Wherein they are no leſſe deceiued than abuſed, bicauſe the woord which is the formall cauſe of the ſacrament is not a word ſayd and ſpoken ſimply, but a declaration of the inſtitution and ordinance of God, don by the Miniſter, according to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the death of Ieſus Chriſt, wyth the fruite of the ſame: by the which the heartes of the hearers are rayſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contemplation and meditation of his benefites, and theyr faith kyndled and enflamed in his loue. And where this is not done, as is ſayd, we muſt not thynke that the elementes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12892:115"/>
are ſacramentes, as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> teacheth vppon <hi>S. Iohn. 80.</hi> Treatiſe, in theſe termes: from whence comes this vertue to the water, that in touching the bodie, it waſheth the heart, but that it is done by the woord, not bicauſe it is pronounced, but by reaſon it is beléeued: this woorde is the woorde of faith which we preache ſayeth the Apoſtle: which is, if we confeſſe with our mouthe that Chriſte is the Lord, and beleeue in our heart, that God hath raiſed him from the deade, we ſhalbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: wherin continuing his matter, he addes in the end theſe woordes: this woorde of faithe which we preache, is the ſame (without doubt) by which baptiſme is conſecrated, to the end it may clenſe and waſhe.</p>
               <p>The miniſters inferre héere before two things, the one, that the woorde of Conſecration is not (as is ſaide) a ſimple pronunciation but a publike and manifeſt declaration of the inſtitution and ordinance with all the miſterie of the deathe of Ieſus Chriſte. The other, that the ſignes and Elementes conſecrated, are not chaunged in reſpecte of their nature and ſubſtance, but onely touching the vſe and ſignification, and that only during the Action in which they ſerue: For, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the ſignes (as the water in Baptiſme, and the breade and wine in the ſupper) is no other thing, than to aſſigne and make them ſerue to a holy and ſacred vſe by the publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the ordinance of God, made to that ende, and not to chaunge them touching their nature and ſubſtance: the which vaniſhing, and being made nothing, there ſhoulde be no more ſigne nor (by conſequence) any ſacrament: So that euen as the water in the Baptiſme, after the Conſecration, remaines water, without that his nature or ſubſtance, be in any thing chaunged or altered: ſo the bread and wine in the ſupper, touching their ſubſtance, remaine, after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuche as they were afore, for there ſhould be no Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie nor correſpondencie betwéene the ſigne and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. For what compariſon &amp; conformitie is there betwene the accidents of the bread, and the truthe of the body of Ieſus Chriſte: ſéeing that the accidents of the breade, as the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and roundneſſe, deſtitute of their ſubſtance (as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters
<pb facs="tcp:12892:116"/>
doe falſly imagine) coulde not nouriſhe or ſuſtaine the bodie, and by that meane ſhould not be proper to ſignifie that the fleſhe and bloude of Ieſus Chriſte nouriſhe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine oure ſoules.</p>
               <p>So that we muſt hold this for reſolute, that the bread and wine remaine in their ſubſtance: the ſame being clearely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by Ieſus Chriſte, who ſpeaking of that which he gaue to his Diſciples to drinke in the Supper, calles it ſpecially the fruite of the Vine:<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> Which can not be referred to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes, but is neceſſarily to be vnderſtanded of the wine in his proper ſubſtance:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> As alſo by that which <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaythe calling the Elementes of the Supper Breade and Wine, thrée ſeuerall times, yea after they were Conſecrated: Like as alſo he wrytes elſewher, we that are many, are one bread and one body, bicauſe we participate all of one lofe: wherein he teacheth vs there by his compariſon of the lofe, that euen as it is made of many graines, ſo wrought and mingled togſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they can not be diſtinguiſhed or ſeperated one from an other, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo alſo ought the faithful in the Church, to be ſo knit and vnited togither in one ſelfe body, as they may ſéeme to be membres one of another. This compariſon wold be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither fooliſhe &amp; out of purpoſe, if the bread which we eate in the ſupper, were not true bread: <hi>Gelaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> wryting againſt <hi>Eutichus,</hi> ſaithe, that the ſacramente which we take is a thing Diuine, and yet forbeares not to be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and nature of breade and wine: <hi>Theodoret</hi> alſo in his firſt Dialogue, vſeth theſe propre termes, the Lorde hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with the name of his bodie and of his bloud the viſible ſignes which repreſente them: without chaunging their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but adding only grace to the nature. The ſame Author in his ſecond Dialogue, ſpeaking alſo of the breade and wine diſtributed in the ſupper, ſaythe, that after the ſanctification, theſe miſticall ſignes forſake not their nature, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in their proper ſubſtance, kinde and figure: by meane whereof, they are ſeene and handled after the Conſecration, neither more or leſſe then afore. <hi>S. Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Monke <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> ſaythe: in the Supper we call
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12892:116"/>
breade that which is there preſent, afore it be ſanctified: And after the ſanctification, by Gods grace and meane of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, it hath no more the name of breade, but of the body of our Lord, yet the nature of bread remaines there.</p>
               <p>By the places aforeſaide, as well of the holy ſcripture, as Auncient Doctors, and others which mighte be yet alleaged for this matter, it appeares that the breade and wine in the ſupper remaine alwayes (as hath bene ſaid) in their proper nature and ſubſtance after the Conſecration as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: wherein it néede not to be doubted that the Faith of the auncient Churche hath not alwayes bene ſo, and that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantitiaon was neither eſtabliſhed nor holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faithe in the Romiſhe Church vntil the time of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the thirde.</p>
               <p>To withſtande and reiecte all that hathe bene ſayde tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the nature and ſubſtance of the ſignes which remaine after the Conſecration, ſuche as be aduerſaries to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, alleage ordinarily the woordes of Ieſus Chriſte, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the breade, in the inſtitution of his ſupper, take, eate, this is my bodie: And ſtaying vpon the proper and natural ſignification of the termes, they defend obſtinately, that the ſubſtance of bread is vaniſhed in the Conſecration, and that there remaines no other ſubſtance, except that of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this, is, that they obſerue not the Figures and manner of ſpéeches, which are ordinarily vſed in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, when and as often as there is Queſtion of the matter of the ſacramentes: For then the name of the things ſignified is ordinarily attributed to the ſignes which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſignifie them: as the name of the alliance is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Circumciſion,<note place="margin">Gene. 17.

The Lambe, by like reaſon is called the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: and Baptiſme, waſhing of regeneration, and that not bicauſe they be things like to the ſignes and myſteries ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them: But for the conformitie that is betweene them:<note place="margin">Epiſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that the error procéedes in that they take and vnderſtand the manners of ſpéeches figured, as if they were propre and naturall.</p>
               <p>That this ſpéeche, take and eate, this my body, is figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: it appeares by that which our Lord Ieſus Chriſte addes after of the cuppe, ſaying: this cuppe is the newe Teſtament in my bloud, which is ſhed for you: Héere he calles the cuppe Teſtament, and new aliance in his bloude: wherin we muſt neceſſarily confeſſe that there is figure, and that with oute it the ſaide place could not be wel vnderſtand, nor aptly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. For it is a thing manifeſt, that an aliance (which is a contrary couenant betwéene parties made and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a certaine promiſſe and woorde:) is not the wine, and yet it is ſo called by figure: bicauſe the wine which is diſtributed in the ſupper, is as the ſeale, by the which the ſaide aliance is ſealed, and the faithe of the ſame confirmed: By ſuche or like manner, muſt we alſo vnderſtand and expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this ſentence: this is my body: the ſame being as much to ſay, as, this is the newe Teſtament in my bodie, which is deliuered for you: For, as by the effuſion of his blud, the new Teſtament was ratified, ſo was it alſo by the death of his body: we néede not ſearche better interpretation of the words of Ieſus Chriſte, than Ieſus Chriſte himſelfe.

the worlde, which is ſacrificed of the Prieſtes, and not killed: And communicating truely with his bodie &amp; precious bloud, we oughte to beléeue that thoſe things are ſignes of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.

               <p>Suche therefore as reade the ſcriptures and Aunciente Fathers, are warned by the diſcourſe of the two manners of ſpéeche aforeſaide, to vſe diligent héede, that for not diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the places where the ſaide ſpéeches are vſurped, they confounde them not, taking that which oughte to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande by figure, as if it were properly ſpoken, and proper ſpéeche, as if it were vnderſtande by Figure: wherein muſt be alwayes remembred in the reading of the ſcripture, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Auncientes, the opinion of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in his Booke of Chriſtian Doctrine: we muſte beware (ſaythe he) that we take not a Figuratiue ſpéeche for the letter: whereunto may be referred the ſaying of the Apoſtle, the letter killeth and the ſpirite reuiues: So that to vnderſtande that which is ſayde by figure, as if it were ſpoken properly, is a fleſhly wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Vppon the ende of the Chapter, he remembreth one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſentence, that it is a miſerable ſeruitude of the ſoule to take the ſignes for the thing ſignified, and not to be able to raiſe the eye of the ſpirite aboue the corporall creature, to drawe the eternall lighte.</p>
               <p>To come to the thirde parte of the ſupper, being the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and celeſtiall thing which is there repreſented and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited vnto vs, as well in the elements, as in the action, we ſay, that it is Ieſus Chriſte crucified &amp; offred on the Croſſe to God his father, for the expiation &amp; perfect ſatiſfaction of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinnes of the world: And to make vs enioy the fruite of this ſacrifice, and to applie to vs iuſtice, remiſſion of ſinnes, life, grace of God, with all the other fauors and bliſſings, which by the ſame ſacrifice haue bene purchaſed &amp; obtained for vs:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12892:119"/>
The word and the Sacramentes haue bene left and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for vs, and ſpecially that of the Supper, wherin as vpon a table we behold Ieſus Chriſt ſufferyng for vs all the dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and anguiſhes of death, paying our debts, and cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the bonde that was againſt vs, carying vppon him ſelfe our malediction, to diſcharge vs of it, and by his obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling vs to God his father, and appeaſing his wrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs. All which thinges are repreſented and aſſured to vs in the Supper, when with a true fayth we come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to celebrate it. Then the Supper was not ordayned to be a ſacrifice propiciatorie (as the Doctors teache, and the Romiſh churche falſly beleueth) but to be a Sacrament, to kéepe freſh, and preſerue alwayes the memorie which wée ought to hold conſtantlye of the death and ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt. There is great difference betwene ſacrament and ſacrifice, bicauſe in ſacrifice we preſent to God our oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and in the ſacrament, God (of the contrarie) doth offer and communicate with vs hys graces and giftes. Alſo in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſynne, there is death and effuſion of bloude of the hoſt and oblation, and not in the ſacrament, but onely the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the fruites and effectes of the ſacrifice. So that in the Supper Ieſus Chriſt is not eftſoones ſacrificed, but the fruites of his obedience, and of the merite of hys ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice are there diſtributed and receiued by the faythfull.</p>
               <p>By the reaſons aforeſayde we conclude, that it is a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie and ſacriledge, to call the bread of the Maſſe of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Prieſt, an hoſt ſaluatorie. And if to proue it the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes be alledged, in whoſe writinges it is found, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Supper was called oblation and ſacrifice: we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that firſt, that belonges nothyng to the Maſſe of the Prieſtes, betwene the which and the Supper there is no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie. And then, that which the auncientes haue ſayde, that they neuer vnderſtoode it a Sacrifice propiciatorie, by the which remiſſion of ſynnes is gotten and obtayned. Neither haue they beleued or thought, that there was an other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to appeaſe Gods wrath, and purchaſe a reconcilement betwene him &amp; men, than the onely ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:12892:120"/>
made by him, onely once vpon the croſſe. We ſay then in effect thrée thinges: firſt that there neither is nor can be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacrificator of the newe Teſtament than Ieſus Chriſt. The reaſons are, bicauſe there is none but he of whom it hath bene ſaid, thou art prieſt eternally, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi> Alſo ther is none but he to whom may be applyed the conditions and eſſentiall qualities of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificator, and of the ſacrificature: which be that the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator be holy, innocent, without ſpot, ſeperated from ſinners, exalted aboue the heauens, who hath not neede euery day to offer ſacrifices, firſt for his own ſinnes, and then for the ſins of the people. Alſo there is none but he, which either is, or may be mediator betwene God and men, that is able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie the deuine iuſtice, capable to beare &amp; endure the wrath of God, that can tame and ouercome death, that by his death and proper bloude is able to procure the ratification of the new teſtament, and who laſtly is able in fauour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of hys merites and dignities, to obtayne of God the remiſſion of ſynne, with other graces which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſuch as ſeeke him and truſt in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſaye there is no other ſacrifice for ſynne, but that of Ieſus Chriſte, who is the onelye Lambe that beares the ſynne of the world, that there is but his bloud, by the which our abominations are waſhed &amp; made cleane. To be ſhort, that God takes no pleaſure in other ſacrifice or oblation, and that he requires no other Holocauſtes nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſynne, and that for this reaſon, Ieſus Chriſt (as is written of him in the roule of the law) is come to do and accompliſh the wyll of God his father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we ſay of the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, that it is onely, and once offered by him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elfe, without néede euer after to repeate or reitterate it, conſidering his perfection and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by the which ſynne is aboliſhed, and perfect and eternall ſanctification obtained to all the choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as appeareth in the. 9 &amp;. 10. to the <hi>Hebrues.</hi> By meane wherof it is no leſſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, &amp; matter contrary to the doctrine and meaning of the Apoſtle, to approue the repeticion and reitteration of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12892:120"/>
ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, than the plurality of ſacrifices for ſin. And if the Doctors would (as hath beene their cuſtome) to diſguiſe and colour ſuch an abuſe, preferre their diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwene the ſacrifice propiciatory, and applicatorie, as to ſay the Prieſtes pretende not in their Maſſes to ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſt for other ende than to apply the merite of hys death to thoſe by whom they celebrate them: We anſwer, that in doyng thus, they would attribute more than they do to Ieſus Chriſt, bicauſe all the fruite of hys ſacrifice comes to vs by the application of the ſame, euen as the healing our cure comes not ſo much of the confection and preparation of the medecine, as by applying the ſame. Beſides we make this queſtion to our Maſters, by what meanes the benefit of the death of Ieſus Chriſt was applyed to the fathers afore his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, ſeeing at that time ther was no Maſſe ſoong. All men of any ſpirit &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may perceiue that thoſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are friuolous, &amp; ſuborned onely to darken the truth, &amp; bleare the eyes of the ſimple and ignorat. For Ieſus Chriſt who hath offered the ſacrifice, is the ſelfe ſame which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to vs by his ſpirite, his woord, and his ſacramentes.</p>
               <p>And now to returne to the matter of our beginning, &amp; to declare to what ende the auncients haue called the Supper &amp; all the action of the ſame ſacrifice: there is to be noted that in the ſupper ther be many ſortes of ſacrifices, as the ſacrifice of a contcite hart, which is offred by publik confeſſion of ſins done there. After, the ſacrifice of our bodies, which is there offred by open praier following the ſaid confeſſion: thirdly, the ſacrifice of praiſe and thanks giuing, there offered, when after the confeſſion &amp; prayers they ſing Pſalmes. The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the goſpel (which is called a ſacrifice <hi>Rom. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </hi>) comes after, as when the confeſſion &amp; praiers being done, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preſents himſelfe to the people, to reueale the woorde of God. Almes (which is an other kinde of ſacrifice) were in times paſt layd to the ſupper by the faythfull: who by thys meane would teſtifie not onely the memorie they had of the graces and benefits of God, but alſo their charity and deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re they had to relieue the neceſſities of their poore neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12892:121"/>Ouer and beſides all theſe kindes of ſacrifices, there bée two particular in the Supper, whereof is mention made in the writinges of the auncientes, the breade and wine which were choſen and taken of the almes brought thether for the poore: and were conſecrated, that is to ſay, aſſigned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the holy &amp; ſacred vſe of the ſupper. The other kinde is the memorie of the death and ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated and repeated in all the action of the Supper, which for this reaſon is called ſacrifice by <hi>S. Iohn Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 16.

Ambroſe</hi> cals it the memorie of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to the ende that we remembring our Redéemer, may obtaine of him to multiply his graces vpon vs. <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> propones it alſo more cleare,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 29.</note> vnder a compariſon of the daies of the paſſion &amp; reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, which he applies in this maner: Often times whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feaſt of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter approcheth, we vſe this maner of ſpeaking, to morow, or within two daies we haue the paſſion or the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt. It cannot be properly vnderſtand of the daye that Chriſt ſuffered death, (which is paſt long ſince) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the memory of his death, the which is ſolemniſed and celebrated as vpon that day, euery yeare. A litle after he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to apropriate his compariſon, hath not Ieſus Chriſte bene offered in himſelfe one onely time: and yet in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, not onely the day of Eaſter, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day he is offered to the people.</p>
               <p>In an other place: the fleſh and bloud of this ſacrifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Ieſus Chriſt were promiſed by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of ſacrifices:<note place="margin">Agaynſt Fauſtine.</note> in the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt they were deliuered vp and offered in truth. And ſince Ieſus Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen, they are celebrated by the ſacrament of memorie. By theſe places and many other like, we maye deduce that the fathers haue often called the ſupper ſacrifice, bicauſe in it the memory of the ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and celebrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:12892:121"/>The name of ſacrifice is alſo often times applyed by the auncientes to the almes brought by the faithfull in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as by <hi>Iuſtine</hi> Martyr in the ſecond Apologie, by <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in his <hi>.20.</hi> boke, chap. <hi>20.</hi> againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> by <hi>S. Ciprian</hi> in his booke of the almes, by <hi>S.

Sometimes the prayers which were made there, were called ſacrifices, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon the dominicall prayer, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the .vij. of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the third booke againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> where alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the place of <hi>Malachie</hi> of the cleane offring which ought to be made to God from the ſunne riſing, tyll the ſettyng of the ſame, ſaith, it ought to be vnderſtand of the Hymnes and prayſes to God, which <hi>S. Ierome</hi> alſo confirmes in hys expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition vpon the ſayd place.</p>
               <p>For concluſion of this matter, we ſay, that all the places of the bookes of the auncientes, wherein touching the matter of the ſupper, is mencion made of the ſacrifice, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to one of the ſayd kindes: neither can it be found, that either they haue ſayd, written, or thought, that there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacrifice propiciatorie, than onelye that whiche Ieſus Chriſt hath once offered on the croſſe in his proper body for our redemption: by which meane it is ſure that he ought to be acknowledged in the Chriſtian church ſacrificator of the new teſtament. And touching the other ſacrifices, as that of a contrite hart, mortification of the fleſh, of thankes geuyng and almes, and the pronouncement and memory of the death of Ieſus Chriſt: we ſaye that generallye it belonges to the church to offer them, and that there is neither faithfull, nor any member in all the body of the Church, who for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is not ſacrificature: as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> chap. <hi>1.</hi> and that for that reaſon we ought to offer in the Supper ſuch ſacrifices vnto God, as appeares euen by the canon of their Maſſe, by them
<pb facs="tcp:12892:122"/>
euill vnderſtanded &amp; applied to the ſacrifice which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, where it is ſayd, for the which we offer thee, or who offer thee. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That which we ſay of the ſacrificature, that it is common to al the church to offer to God ſacrifice of thankes giuyng, ought not to be ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derouſly interpreted, as though we wold confuſe the eccleſiaſtical miniſtery, wyth the ſayd ſacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by that meane reuerſe and trouble the order of the church, giuing to euery one an autority &amp; power to gouerne it. For we know well inough that vocations are different amongſt the people of God, and that it is neceſſarye, that in the church ther be Paſtors &amp; Doctors, with other Miniſters (as Deacons and Auncients) to guide it well and edifie, as well by continual preaching of the word, as carefull execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other thinges concerning their charges: onelye wee muſt diſtinguiſh thoſe vocations which are particular, from the ſacrificature aforeſaid, which ought to be generall and common (as is ſayd) to all the Church.</p>
               <p>Such now, as with diligence wyll obſerue the matters here before diſcourſed &amp; proued by Gods word, may eaſely ſee &amp; iudge, that the Maſſe as it is celebrate at this day in the Romiſh church, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole corruption &amp; reuerſement of the inſtitution of the ſupper which Ieſus Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed and left in his church, ſo that at this daye it is impoſſible to finde or diſcerne one onely mark of his firſt ordinance. For of a ſacrament which Ieſus Chriſt left in his church to ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and entertain it in a preſent memory of his death, they haue made a ſacrifice, by the which the remembrance of the ſame Ieſus Chriſt is altogether buried &amp; defaced. Wherin there is this thing ſpecially maruelous, and no leſſe worthy to be wel noted, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which appertained not but to the ſonne of God, &amp; impoſſible to any to do but to himſelfe, as to ſacrifice for ſynne, to reconcile men vnto God, to appeaſe his wrath towards them, &amp; to interceſſe for fauour and helpe of them, the Preſts attribute to themſelues. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is lawfull &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, yea &amp; poſſible for them to do, as to ſolemniſe the memory of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; in taking, breaking, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12892:122"/>
and eating the bread, and drinking the wine, to declare his death, they haue altogether left. So that as we may ſay that whatſoeuer Chriſt did in the ſupper, and commaunded to do, the Prieſtes do nothing at all, euen ſo, what he did on the croſſe, and commaunded man neuer to do it, the Prieſts vndertake and ſeeke to do it.</p>
               <p>The errors and abuſes aſwel of tranſubſtanciation, as of ſacrificature, and ſacrifice expiatory, and the repeticion of the ſame, which be the principall partes, and (as it were) the groundes of the Maſſe, haue bene heretofore confuted, and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ouerthrown, as wel by Gods word, as other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here alledged in the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the parts of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſupper. And now ther reſtes no more to batter wholy this Idol, but to ſhew that the reſidue of the Maſſe is no better ſtuffe, nor better grounded in Gods word. For the adoration which is there done to the bread and wine is an idolatry condemned and curſed of God. And it is not likely to be true, that Ieſus Chriſt inſtituting the ſupper, had not ordained it, &amp; <hi>S. Paule</hi> reciting this as he had receiued it of the Lord, had not taught it, and that the auncient church had omitted it, if it had bene a thing wherin God might haue bene any way honored.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the ſeperation of the Prieſt from the people, is directly contrary to the article of faith of the Communion of the church, and contrary to the purpoſe &amp; end for the which the ſupper was ordained: the ſame tending to confirme and entertaine the ſocietie that ought to be betwene the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and bynde them alwayes more ſtrayghtly one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that as it cannot be more rightly tearmed than a preſumption intollerable, and a manyfeſt diſdayne of the reſt of Gods people: So that whiche the Doctors haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to excuſe and couer ſuch a ſacriledge, is no leſſe vaine and friuolous, which is, that the Maſſe of the Prieſtes doth not forbeare to be good, not withſtanding the aſſiſtants wyl not communicate ther. For firſt, they are forbidden to eate alone in the ſupper, and there is no ſupper where is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> teacheth, rebuking the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for departing one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other in the celebration of their ſupper.
<pb facs="tcp:12892:123"/>
When (ſaith he) you aſſemble your ſelues together, it is not to eate the ſupper of the Lord, ſéeing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye come to eating, euery one aduaunceth to take it particularlye.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> Therefore, vpon the end of the chapter, teaching them what forme to vſe therein, he ſayth: therefore (my brethren) when you aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to eate, tary one for an other. Beſides, it happeneth often times that in their Maſſe, there is none but the Prieſt, and a litle Clarke to aunſwer him, whom they wyll not take to communicate with them.</p>
               <p>Alſo, howe can they excuſe the Maſſes which are ſoong in Monaſteries, wher the people are defended to communicate with the Moonkes that celebrate them? yea, it is ordinarelye ſéene in great pariſhes, in <hi>Paris</hi> and elſwhere, that when the people communicate, they are ſeperate from the Preſts, who doing their buſineſſe a part, diſdayne to eate and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at one table with them. And what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is there betwene the Prieſtes and the people, ſéeing that in place to breake in the aſſemblye, one ſelfe loafe (to the ende that all participating therein, ſhoulde by that meane be the more ſtraightly conioyned and knyt in one ſelfe body) euerye one hath his owne a part: the Prieſt a greater, and the people one ſomewhat leſſe: Séeing alſo the Chalice is in no ſort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed. Furthermore, what indeuor is vſed by the preſts to inuite and exhorte the people to comunicate wyth them, yea euen the Biſhops, who at this day hold it as a matter of ſhame to communicate with Artiſans, and other people of meane condition.</p>
               <p>For concluſion, if the Doctors had well conſidered the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the auncients, who cauſed to go out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, wher the Communion was done, the <hi>Catachumeni,</hi> and others not prepared to communicate: And likewiſe if they had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the doctrine of <hi>S. Iohn Chriſoſtome,</hi> ſhame would haue forbid them to defend ſuch an abuſe and impietie,<note place="margin">Sermo. 3. ad Epheſi.</note> as is that of their Maſſe. Wherin to the ende the people ſhal not reſt ignorant in the opinion of that holy Doctor, we wyl here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it word by word: It is in vayne that the dayly oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is done, it is in vayne that we remayne at the aulter, ther is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12892:123"/>
no body that Communicates there: I ſay not this to the ende you Communicate in any faſhion, but to the ende you make your ſelues woorthy of it. Arte thou not woorthy to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate? no more art thou to pray. A little after he ſaythe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if any were called to a banket, and waſhed his handes, and being ſet at the table, did not eate nor taſte any thing of the meates there ſerued, ſhould he not doe diſhonor &amp; wrong to him that inuited him: had it not bene better for him not to haue come thither, euen thus is it of thée: For thou art come, thou haſt ſong Pſalmes with the reſt of the people, thou haſt confeſſed thy ſelfe to be of the number of the worthy, and not departing from thoſe that are vnwoorthy: how then doſt thou tary, and not participate at the table of the Lord: thou ſayſt, I am vnwoorthy, I anſwere thee, that euen ſo arte thou alſo, touching the Communion of Prayers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the gobbins and tronſhons of the Goſpels and Piſtles, the Creede, Prayer, and other péeces referred to the ſcripture, altogither confuſed and ſhaken of, pronounced to the people in a tong not vnderſtand (contrary to the expreſſe commaundemente of God, and without any edifying of the multitude) is no other thing than a vaine vſurpation of the name of God, againſt the expreſſe defence made by the ſame: which ornaments are too narow and ſhort to couer the ſhame and horror of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what execrable abuſe is it to ſay, that the Maſſe ſerues not only to the liuing, but alſo for the dead, to obtaine remiſſion of their ſinnes: wherin the prieſtes forgetting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhame nor blaſphemie, deuide their ofte into three parts, with this viſor vppon it, that one is for them that be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, an other for ſuche as liue on earth, and the thirde ſerues for the ſoules that abide in purgatorie. But the Sacrament, which is not ordained but to confirme the faith of the word, ſtretcheth no further then the miniſterie, and the miniſterie no longer than this life: ſo that if it be ſo that thoſe that are in heuen, &amp; ſuch likewiſe as are fained to be in purgatorie be dead and departed this world: we muſt neceſſarily conclude that as Gods woorde can not be preached vnto them, ſo alſo
<pb facs="tcp:12892:124"/>
they cannot pertake in the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and if they be not adminiſtred to them, they can nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite them.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12892:126"/>
no other purpoſe, than not at all to enter the conference, but rather to kéepe things in ſuſpence vntil they grew weary, by which meanes this holy purpoſe mighte altogither diſſolue &amp; breake: in the ends, they beſoughte him humbly to aduiſe the Doctors (without vaine varietie or change of matter) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the difference, and refute that which the Miniſters had maintained of the ſupper, and defend that which they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>All this notwithſtanding, there ran immediately a brute thorow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne that <hi>Vigor</hi> was falne into a dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without likelihoode of ſpéedy recouery, the ſame giuing a feare to the Miniſters to be intercepted in their laſte hope: which they doubted ſo muche the more, as at the inſtant they were told that Doctor <hi>Sainctes,</hi> was alſo gone out of <hi>Paris</hi> to the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> by which they could not otherwayes preſume, than that they ſhould be enforced to a long abode in <hi>Paris</hi> without any ſette exerciſe to occupie the time, as being come thither but by chance: for <hi>Spyna</hi> but made it in his way to paſſe into <hi>Aufon,</hi> and for the other, being Miniſter to the Church of <hi>Orleans</hi> it was not long ſince he was taken out of priſon, whether he was led in Iune afore, vpon a falſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by the enimies of Gods Churche; charging him to be Author of a moſt pernitious &amp; wicked Boke written againſt the obedience to Kings and Princes, by which he founde it very inconuenient for him to tarie ſo long in the Towne, whether he came not at the firſt willingly.</p>
               <p>For theſe reſpects they reſolued eftſones to returne to the Lord of <hi>Neuers,</hi> and alſo to tel him that ſéeing doctor <hi>Sainctes</hi> (who might haue taried and drawne to him in <hi>Vigors</hi> place ſome other at his pleſure) was departed without any aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of his returne: there was alſo no reaſon of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode ſtil, as wel in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incertaintie of their buſineſſe, as alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their Churches had neede of them for the exerciſe of their charge as they deſired: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, in the end, they
